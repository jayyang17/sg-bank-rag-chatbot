# sg-bank-rag-chatbot

**LangChain-powered RAG chatbot for querying DBS, OCBC, and UOB annual reports (2022‚Äì2023).**  
Modular, production-ready architecture with semantic search via ChromaDB and GPT-4 for contextual answers.

> Project is under active development ‚Äî currently in **Phase 1: Data Ingestion**.

## Project Overview

This chatbot/API system enables users (investors, analysts, etc.) to ask natural language questions about Singapore banks' annual reports and receive concise, source-grounded responses.

Designed to:
- Showcase modern Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques
- Support local and cloud deployment
- Serve as a core portfolio project for LLM engineering

## Phase Progress

| Phase                         | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| Phase 1: Data Ingestion       | Extracted text, chunked, and tagged with metadata |
| Phase 2: Embedding & Indexing | Generate embeddings and store in Chroma vector DB |
| Phase 3: Retrieval & QA       | Build RetrievalQA chain using LangChain + GPT-4 |
| Phase 4: Frontend             | Flask interface or Telegram bot integration |
| Phase 5: Deployment           | Dockerized app with CI/CD to AWS EC2 |
| Phase 6: Evaluation           | Manual scoring, token tracking, latency benchmarks |
