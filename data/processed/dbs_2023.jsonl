After hiking interest rates seven times in 2022, the Federal Reserve – in a bid to combat the highest inflation in generations – raised short-term borrowing costs by another four times to 5.25-5.5%, the highest level in 22 years. Central banks around the world followed suit. Elevated interest rates dampened consumer and investment demand, and stymied global trade. US-China tensions, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, as well as the Israel-Hamas conflict, added to the uncertainty. DBS’ key markets Singapore and Hong Kong – being small, open economies – were impacted by slowing external demand. Singapore’s economy grew 1.1% in 2023, down from 3.8% the year before. Hong Kong’s economy did better – with advance estimates indicating that it expanded by 3.2% – though this was weaker than expected. Against this backdrop, we delivered a solid financial performance, with net profit and return on equity at record highs.

A record year For the year, DBS delivered record total income of SGD 20.2 billion, crossing the SGD 20 billion mark for the first time. Net profit rose 26% to an all-time high of SGD 10.3 billion. Return on equity (ROE), at 18.0%, broke all previous records.Earnings were propelled by tailwinds from a rising interest rate environment, with net interest margin expanding 40 basis points to 2.15%. Non-interest income also recovered strongly, bolstered by wealth management fees, card fees and loan-related fees. Our solid financial performance was not just a reflection of the macro-economic environment, but also a result of the structural shifts made to our franchise in the last decade. In particular, our focus on digitalisation, cash management and wealth management broadened our low-cost deposit base, from which we benefitted in 2023. Meanwhile, we transformed DBS Private Bank to become one of the top three in Asia, compared to in 2010, when it was outside the top 20.

To future-proof ourselves, we need to strengthen our existing competencies and invest in new capabilities, while being nimble enough to respond to any unexpected changes in the external environment. As we have done in the past, we will continue to build on our DNA as an innovation-led, purpose-driven bank to build a sustainable advantage. Cementing our Asia franchise Even with a slowing China, Asia’s structural growth story is very much intact. Asia’s large, growing middle class; burgeoning wealth; massive infrastructure needs; as well as rising intra-Asia trade underpin its prospects. Through the inorganic transactions we did in the Covid-19 years, we have now reached inflection point in India and Taiwan in terms of scale.In India, following the integration of Lakshmi Vilas Bank, we now have more than 520 branches in 350+ locations, and a complete suite of products for every market segment. Outside Singapore, we have the most complete platform in India. With a deep footprint in five southern Indian states, growing brand recognition, and a continued rollout of new products and partnerships, we are seeing payoff to the business. In 2023, the consumer banking business saw double-digit income growth by scaling and deepening partnerships with ecosystem players such as Bajaj Finance and Cred. We also leveraged our expanded customer franchise and footprint to increase market penetration of personal loans, gold loans, small business loans and insurance. Overall, our customer base grew 18%, while income and net profit rose 15% and 30% respectively. In August, DBS completed the acquisition of Citigroup Inc.’s consumer banking business in Taiwan. With the transaction, DBS has become Taiwan’s largest foreign bank by assets. DBS Taiwan’s consumer business growth has been accelerated by at least 10 years, and annual revenue was propelled past the SGD 1.3 billion mark. Our consumer banking customers in Taiwan more than doubled to about 1.1 million. We also have clear market leadership in loans, deposits, cards and investments among foreign players in the market. We continued to make important strides in China. Since its borders reopened in 2023, we have seen an uptick in China connectivity with Singapore and other ASEAN countries. To capture business opportunities from China, we launched a foreign direct investment desk in Singapore. Our “China plus one” strategy, supporting companies wanting to diversify their supply chains and operations, had good traction. We also continued to make headway in growing our Greater Bay Area (GBA) franchise, both in wealth management as well as in banking corporates in the electric vehicle, high-tech manufacturing and new economy industries. In early 2024, we upped our stake in Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank (SRCB) from 13% to 16.69%. SRCB is a high-returns bank, in which we are the largest shareholder, and gives us a good footprint in the GBA. 630045_DBS_AR23_Front Section_p001-041_RG4.indd   9 22/2/24   1:02 PM\nMaturing new ways of working To create a sustainable advantage, DBS continued to focus on three areas that are differentiating. The first is the industrialisation of artificial intelligence (AI)/ machine learning (ML) and data analytics. Our use of AI/ ML became even broad-based in 2023, and delivered economic value of SGD 370 million, more than double that in 2022. The value created comprises incremental revenue from anticipating customers’ needs and serving them better, losses averted from scams and fraud, and productivity gains. The bank also started experimenting with Generative AI to improve the way we work.DBS’ focus on Managing through Journeys (MtJs) matured yet further. MtJs bring together cross-functional squads guided by data-driven control towers, enabling us to be more agile in delivering new products, and responding to customer pain points and needs. In 2021, we had 25 customer journeys; this rose to 40+ in 2022 and increased to more than 60 in 2023. Through MtJs, we see improved customer satisfaction, faster turnaround times and positive revenue impact.Finally, we continued to make headway in growing our ecosystem partnerships, enabling us to scale customer acquisition especially in the large Asian markets.

Launching the world’s first bank-backed multi-family office VCC for wealth families Amid rising interest from ultra-high net worth families to set up family offices in Singapore, DBS Private Bank launched the world’s first bank-backed multi- family office that leverages Singapore’s Variable Capital Company structure. The programme offers clients the option of managing their wealth in Singapore without the need to establish a Single Family Office. Clients can also access a full suite of services including investment management, trade execution and custody solutions via a single integrated platform.Dialling up anti-scam measures and education to safeguard customers To protect our customers from new scam typologies, we rolled out new security measures that can thwart malware threats and enable customers to lock up their accounts. These measures add to existing safeguards, including surveillance and monitoring systems enabled by artificial intelligence and machine learning. We also worked with ecosystem partners including the Singapore Police Force to dial up customer education through various digital literacy and fraud prevention community programmes. Forging ecosystem partnerships to expand our consumer finance business We expanded our consumer finance business by working with 11 ecosystem partners in various markets outside Singapore. They include Kredivo, JD.com and Cred. The volume of loans disbursed across these markets grew 118% to SGD 3.4 billion. Enabling digital trade transformation through technology and connectivity We continued to drive cross-border digital trade transformation across the region. In August, we successfully completed the first live interoperable electronic bills of lading transaction between Singapore and India. The transaction was implemented under the TradeTrust framework, an initiative by the Infocomm Media Development Authority and supported by Enterprise Singapore. Driving regional payments through digitalisation Our digital capabilities enabled us to grow real-time payment volumes by more than 50% compared to 2022. Active commercialisation and regionalisation of new cash management products and services enabled us to capture over 1,000 new cash management mandates regionally. Leveraging AI/ ML to help our clients make better investment decisions We continued to leverage data analytics and artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ ML) to deepen our engagement with customers. In 2023, we engaged 8.6 million customers across the region via personalised nudges, guiding them towards better investment and financial planning decisions.\n16 DBS ANNUAL REPORT 2023       BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE ADVANTAGE Forging a Future From our inception as the Development Bank of Singapore, DBS has always been guided by a strong sense of purpose.

Two principal factors have contributed to our financial outperformance.The first is our focus on Asia. Notwithstanding slowing China growth, Asia remains the fastest-growing region in the world. This has been fuelled by structural trends: a rising middle class, burgeoning affluent population, greater cross-border flows and massive demand for infrastructure investment. We have strategically shaped our business to capture these trends. For example, our wealth management franchise rides the wave of rising affluence while our treasury and transaction banking solutions have been scaled to capture growing trade and investment flows.Additionally, having a footprint in Asia’s three key axes of growth – Southeast Asia, South Asia and Greater China – through our focus on six key markets has been advantageous. We are able to intermediate intra-Asia trade and capital flows. Being anchored in Singapore and Hong Kong positions us to serve the regional headquarters of western and Asian multinationals while our local franchises in China, Indonesia, India and Taiwan enable us to go deep by serving local businesses and consumers.  The diversification also enables us to navigate divergences in economic cycles. For many years, Greater China was a significant propellant of our growth as we rode on China enterprises’ outbound expansion and Hong Kong’s role in the mainland’s development. Today, we are fortuitously placed to capture India’s accelerating growth momentum.The second factor is the digital transformation we embarked on a decade ago. Because of the long gestation period before the fruits become tangible – to our customers in terms of convenience and ease, to our staff in terms of how they work, and to our shareholders in terms of the concomitant financial impact – our head start has continued to set us apart as a bank, employer and investment. Our digital platforms have made it easier for customers to carry out the full range of everyday transactions. As a result, customer engagement has deepened, translating into stickier relationships and greater wallet share, and ultimately faster revenue growth.", "bank": "DBS", "year": "2023"}
{"section_title": "CEOreȵ ectionsDigitalisation has enabled us to become market leaders in high-return", "content": "CEOreȵ ectionsDigitalisation has enabled us to become market leaders in high-returns businesses such as wealth management. Meanwhile, our APIs (or pipes linking our systems with clients’) have driven market share gains in cash management. We can also structure treasury products at speed and scale and with attractive pricing. Technology has also improved the way our employees work and is central to our efforts to create a culture different from a traditional institution’s. It has enabled data to be quickly sorted, packaged and shared among teams, making it instrumental in breaking down silos. Decisions can be made and implementation carried out expeditiously, giving us the agility akin to a startup's. Not constrained by organisational limitations, we are able to adopt the customer’s perspective when creating products and services, resulting in a differentiated customer experience.The institutionalisation of digitalisation into our franchise has also meant we can readily experiment with and assimilate new technologies that will ineluctably arise. We have infused artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ ML) into more than 350 use cases across the bank to drive productivity. We have expanded our business through ecosystem partnerships by using AI/ ML and data to identify the subset of existing customers in those platforms that we can suitably and profitably offer our products to. Ecosystem partnerships have helped double our Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management customer base over the past six years to 18 million today.These dual characteristics of our franchise – unique geographical footprint and innate digital capabilities – are strategic advantages that are difficult to replicate. They are also the drivers of our performance. Their value has only become more apparent as interest rates rose. The record ROE we achieved in 2023 is one of the highest among developed market banks and six percentage points above the last time when interest rates and credit costs were at similar levels. We believe that the franchise we have developed will enable us to continue outperforming peers into the future. Q22023 was the year of Gen AI and the use of AI will proliferate even more greatly in the years to come. It is also a big focus area for DBS. What excites you most about the space, and what about it keeps you up at night? AI and Gen AI are game changers, and we will see significant developments in the next five years that will fundamentally shape the way we work. The use of AI is not new to DBS, and we have been working with AI for over a decade now. 14.0 11.5 9.9 7.511.5 11.410.6 10.111.718.0 15.0 12.5 9.113.2 12.1 9.710.111.2SG peer average4pp above peersDBS 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2015Return on equity (%) 630045_DBS_AR23_Front Section_p001-041_RG4.indd   18 22/2/24   1:02 PM19", "bank": "DBS", "year": "2023"}

For whom?\". In most cases, we can earn a fair return while creating such value. In some instances, we compromise on short-term returns for the greater good. Our dealings with migrant labour in Singapore are a case in point. From pure economics, one could easily make the case that we should pass on this unprofitable segment. However, recognising our role as the people's bank, we chose to grapple with the problem, and figure ways to drive down the cost to serve and make the business viable. b While our strategies will continue to evolve, going forward, as part of our business, we will see what we can do to address four wicked problems besetting our world. bThese are: (i) climate change (ii) demographic shifts, particularly ageing societies (iii) rising income inequality and the growing social divide, and (iv) issues of trust. These issues are mammoth; however, the private sector – with its resources and talent pool – has an active role to play in tackling them in concert with governments and civil society. bb A second agenda that is informed by being purpose-driven is the need to uphold the trust our customers place in us. bVarious customer surveys indicate that being financially strong, as well as providing banking that is secure and reliable, are key to being trusted.bDBS’ robust franchise, underpinned by a solid balance sheet and prudent", "bank": "DBS", "year": "2023"}

Q3DBS often says that being purpose-driven is part of its DNA. How does this translate into the way the bank operates its business or interacts with society? DBS was formed as the Development Bank of Singapore in 1968 to help finance the nation’s industrialisation, so a deep sense of purpose is strongly ingrained in our ethos. This shows up in a very clear approach – we are not just here to make profits in any way possible; we are here because we have a meaningful role to play in the economy and society, and our actions must always reflect this reality. Banking and finance have had a very significant role to play over the ages – bhelping individuals save for the future, buy a home or grow their wealth. Banks also help companies grow by financing trade and enabling working capital efficiencies. Even though bankers have gone off course from time to time, the most sustainable banking models have been built on doing real things for real people. In recognition of this, our purpose at DBS is to drive amazing solutions and experiences for our customers, to make banking joyful and create a more sustainable bank.In the past five years, we have scaled our AI capabilities to make it pervasive across all parts of the bank, delivering tangible outcomes of SGD 370 million for DBS in 2023, more than double that of the previous year. We are confident of growing the economic impact of our AI initiatives in the coming years, affording us greater flexibility to navigate through business and economic cycles.What’s different with the emergence of Gen AI is that we now have the ability to process vast amounts of unstructured data. Coupled with our existing capabilities around structured data, we are well placed to sharpen the outcomes of our current AI use cases while enabling a new class of data-driven use cases.

We believe these initiatives will enable us to sustain medium-term ROE at 15-17% after assuming more normalised interest rates and credit conditions. Record performance in 2023 The group’s net interest income grew 25% to SGD 13.6 billion as full-year net interest margin expanded 40 basis points to 2.15%. Significantly, after an increase of 62 basis points in the four quarters of 2022, quarterly net interest margin continued to rise in the first three quarters of 2023, deviating from peers, before easing in the fourth quarter. The improvement was due to the repricing of floating-rate assets as well as a portion of fixed-rate assets. Deposit costs also increased, but at a slower rate as Casa outflows eased during the year. Net interest income for the commercial book, which excluded Treasury Markets, rose by a faster 33% while its net interest margin increased 65 basis points to 2.76%. Higher funding costs and accounting asymmetry resulted in a bigger drag in Treasury Markets’ net interest income as interest rates rose. The drag was partially offset by higher gains in Treasury Markets non-interest income.Loans were little changed at SGD 416 billion. Excluding Citi Consumer Taiwan, which added SGD 10 billion, underlying loans fell 1% or SGD 4 billion. Trade loans declined 8% or SGD 3 billion, accounting for most of the full-year decline in group loans, due to lower activity and unattractive pricing. Non-trade corporate loans were stable at SGD 246 billion. Although the loan pipeline was healthy, rising interest rates resulted in higher repayments from corporates that had spare cash on hand. By geography, growth in Singapore and India was offset by a decline in Greater China, where the greatest repayments occurred due to the significantly lower interest rates in the mainland.Housing loans were little changed as loan disbursements were offset by repayments. Disbursements were lower as new bookings declined from the previous year in line with market transactions after a new round of cooling measures in April 2023. Other consumer loans declined 2% or SGD 1 billion as wealth management customers repaid loans in a high interest rate environment. Deposits rose 3% to SGD 535 billion. Excluding Citi Consumer Taiwan, which added SGD 12 billion, underlying deposits Digitally-transformed franchise with structurally higher ROE We achieved a record performance for a third consecutive year in 2023 as net profit rose 26% to SGD 10.3 billion. Total income grew 22% to cross SGD 20 billion for the first time from a higher net interest margin, a rebound in fee income and record treasury customer sales. The underlying cost-income ratio improved to 39%. Asset quality continued to be resilient with specific allowances remaining low at 11 basis points of loans.Notably, return on equity (ROE) reached a new high of 18%, significantly above previous years and placing us among the world’s best performing banks. The ROE was six percentage points above 2006 when Fed rates were last above 5% and credit conditions similarly benign, reflecting structural improvements from the franchise and digital transformations we carried out over the past decade. At the same time, our ROE advantage over peers also widened.At our Digital Investor Day in May 2023, we highlighted three ways that our digital transformation had boosted ROE. First, it strengthened our current and savings account (Casa) franchise by improving our standing as the primary bank for retail and corporate customers. During the quantitative easing of 2020-21, our Casa deposits increased by 60% or SGD 143 billion to SGD 381 billion, faster than the industry. More than half of this increase was in foreign currencies, enabling us to grow foreign currency loans with greater profitability. Despite industry-wide Casa outflows since mid-2022 due to rising interest rates, total Casa deposits at end-2023 were SGD 48 billion higher than at end-2019. Our SGD and foreign currency Casa ratios stood at 86% and 35% in 2023 compared to 69% and 21% in 2006. Second, technology and data enabled us to gain wallet share in fee income from better customer targeting and engagement. Since 2014, our fee income has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 6%. This was significantly faster than peers, which continued to be the case in 2023. We achieved a stronger recovery in wealth management fees following an industry-wide decline in 2022 when interest rates rose and geopolitical tensions flared. Net new money inflows, which had more than doubled in 2022 compared to the average of preceding years, were sustained in 2023 at SGD 24 billion. As", "bank": "DBS", "year": "2023"}

Higher interest rates boosted net interest margin and more than offset a decline in loans. Non-interest income improved from higher treasury customer sales and growth in cards and wealth management fees. Hong Kong income increased 10% to SGD 3.21 billion, led by an expansion in net interest margin while non-interest income was little changed. Rest of Greater China benefited from the consolidation of Citi Consumer Taiwan as income grew 20% to SGD 1.40 billion with double-digit percentage increases in net interest income and non-interest income. Expenses rose 14% to SGD 8.06 billion led by an increase in staff costs from salary increments and a higher headcount.

Profit before allowances grew 29% to a record SGD 12.1 billion. Balance sheet remains strong Asset quality remained resilient throughout the year. Non-performing assets were little changed at SGD 5.06 billion and the non-performing loans (NPL) ratio was unchanged at 1.1%. New non-performing asset formation remained low and was more than offset by repayments and write-offs. Specific allowances amounted to 11 basis points of loans or SGD 512 million, slightly above the eight basis points a year ago and remaining below the cycle average. General allowances of SGD 78 million were taken compared to a write-back of SGD 98 million in the previous year. Total allowance reserves amounted to SGD 6.48 billion, comprising general allowance reserves of SGD 3.90 billion and specific allowance reserves of SGD 2.58 billion. Allowance coverage was at 128% and at 226% when collateral was considered. Capital remained strong, with the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio unchanged at 14.6%. The leverage ratio of 6.6% was more than twice the regulatory requirement of 3%.

Outlook At time of writing, the macroeconomic outlook has become more settled after an extended period of uncertainty. There is consensus that interest rates have peaked and the debate is on the pace of reductions. The International Monetary Fund recently raised its forecast for global growth for 2024 from 2.9% previously to 3.1%, saying it saw a higher chance for a soft landing. With the greater clarity, consumer and investor confidence have also improved.The better outlook will support our business prospects in the coming year. We expect net interest income to be maintained around 2023 levels as loan growth offsets the effects of a slightly lower net interest margin. Fee income should grow by double-digit percentage terms. Wealth management should benefit from stronger investor confidence and the strong net new money inflows we have had, while cards should benefit from further growth in spending and travel. All these income streams will also benefit from the full-period impact of the Citi Consumer Taiwan consolidation.Although asset quality remains resilient, we are assuming credit costs will begin to normalise with specific allowances moving towards 17-20 basis points of loans. In the event that credit costs deteriorate beyond our assumptions, we have the capacity to release general allowance overlays that had been prudently built up in previous years. If these forecasts hold, we expect full-year earnings for the coming year to be around the record levels in 2023, with ROE within our medium-term range of 15-17%.

For the consumer and SME businesses in Singapore and Hong Kong, the proportion of digital customers exceeded the 60% target set in 2017, reaching 62%. Income per customer and ROE for the digital segment continued to outperform that of traditional customers, affirming the value of digitalisation in enhancing customer engagement and operational efficiency. Digital customers generated three times the income on average than traditional ones, reflecting more diverse product holdings and more transactions. Having achieved our digital adoption target, focus shifted to intensifying efforts to capture larger wallet shares. At the investor day in May, we outlined our approach, including the use of data and AI/ ML models to generate hyper-personalised nudges, to drive increased product adoption and revenue per customer. Beyond the consumer and SME businesses in Singapore and Hong Kong, digital transformation became more pervasive across the organisation. At the investor day, we highlighted the expansion of digitalisation efforts in recent years to wealth management, transaction services and treasury customer sales across the region. The percentage of group income from these high-ROE segments rose from 40% in 2017 to 46% in 2022, and further increased to 52% in 2023, with income from wealth management, transaction services and treasury customer sales all achieving record levels. Our digital efforts in these areas, such as leveraging data and AI/ ML to provide relationship managers with insights to better engage their customers, and investments in API and core processing capabilities to seize opportunities in low-value real-time payments, supply chain financing and treasury customer solutions, advanced our goal of becoming the primary bank for an increasing number of wealth and business clients. This contributed to accelerated growth in foreign currency deposits and improved cross-sell into fee and treasury customer income-based activities.

At the investor day, we explained our phygital approach in these markets, and outlined our aim to grow a high-quality base of consumer and SME customers and improve ROEs with increased scale. We effectively extended our reach through ecosystem partnerships by leveraging our extensive API and connectivity capabilities. We also scaled our business through inorganic acquisitions. In Taiwan, we acquired Citi Consumer Taiwan which positioned us as the largest foreign bank in Taiwan by assets with leading positions in deposits, cards and investments. The acquisition of LVB in 2020 was a similar move to boost scale. LVB significantly expanded our network and customer base in India, providing a scaled platform to overlay our digital banking capabilities. Since 2017, the cumulative growth in customers in our four growth markets, including from ecosystem partnerships and acquisitions, amounted to about eight million. During the same period, total income from these markets grew 84% while net profits surged by almost five-fold.Wealth(1) GTS TM salesGrowth in high-ROE businesses Income (as % of group) Categories combined 0404652 1020304050 2022 2023 2017 630045_DBS_AR23_Front Section_p001-041_RG4.indd   22 22/2/24   1:03 PM23", "bank": "DBS", "year": "2023"}

Yields on loans and other interest-bearing assets repriced higher with interest rates. Although deposit costs also rose, the pace was slower compared to asset yields. The growth in commercial book net interest income was moderated by a decline in Treasury Markets net interest income. Treasury Markets faced higher funding costs for its operations as interest rates rose. The drag on its net interest income was partially offset by gains in the non-interest income line.Overall net interest income grew 25% to SGD 13.6 billion. Gross loans increased 1% or SGD 6 billion in constant-currency terms to SGD 422 billion. The consolidation of Citi Consumer Taiwan added SGD 10 billion to loans, more than offsetting a SGD 3 billion decline in trade loans resulting from lower activity and unattractive pricing. Non-trade corporate loans were stable. Despite a healthy loan pipeline, rising interest rates led to higher repayments. Additionally, there was a shift in China corporate borrowing to cheaper options onshore in the first half. Housing loans were little changed, with a SGD 1 billion growth in the fourth quarter offsetting a decline in the first nine months. Other consumer loans fell SGD 1 billion as wealth management customers repaid loans in a high interest rate environment. Deposits rose 3% or SGD 13 billion in constant-currency terms to SGD 535 billion. Citi Consumer Taiwan contributed SGD 12 billion, while underlying deposits were stable.

Safe-guarding against evolving ȴ nancial crime The money laundering and sanctions threat landscape continued to evolve. Our investments in developing, deploying and operationalising new tools based on data analytics and artificial intelligence/ machine learning (AI/ ML) proved to be effective. In many cases, the tools demonstrated two to four times better detection than historical controls with greater efficiency of 10-30%. These capabilities were particularly effective at detecting and interdicting money laundering and sanctions evasion networks of shell companies. Notwithstanding this, criminals would likely alter their methods and we would need to devote efforts to preventing exploitation of citizenships in the consumer bank, as well as new techniques to increase customer protection against scams and the laundering of proceeds from scams.We also actively participated in and contributed to many initiatives, both domestic and international.To combat digital payment scams, we implemented new surveillance measures to detect malware and used AI to detect anomalies in customer account behaviour which could indicate a scam victim or a mule.

To ensure that these services have minimal downtime, for critical applications, we have now added hot standby capabilities to supplement existing active-active configurations. Additionally, today, some of our services are delivered through common/ shared systems, which can potentially result in single points of failure. To prevent this, we are decoupling these shared systems at both the front and back ends so that key services are always available on at least one channel. This will be completed by 1Q 2024.To complement our engagement with vendors, we have established 10 Centres of Excellence (COEs) that house expertise across different domains. The COEs will drive standardisation of architecture and reuse of assets, uphold quality service delivery, and develop competency for shared application software and services.Our mobile applications have been enhanced to detect and remove the presence of malware.

With an improved cost-income ratio, net profit before tax grew 59% to SGD 4.28 billion. Net interest income rose 45% to SGD 6.2 billion, driven by higher Fed rates and stronger deposit earnings in most of our markets. The growth was however moderated by margin compression in our asset portfolio. Overall, we still saw resilient growth in balances.Non-interest income grew to SGD 2.76 billion due to higher investments and bancassurance product sales, cards and unsecured loan-related fees. Card fees rose 22% to SGD 1.04 billion, as travel spending surpassed pre-pandemic levels in all markets. Despite intensifying competition, we upheld our market share lead in savings deposits, cards and the mortgage loan space in Singapore.

We expanded our consumer finance business by working with 11 ecosystem partners such as Kredivo, JD.com and Cred to offer lending solutions to their customers. The volume of loans disbursed across these markets grew 118% to SGD 3.4 billion. Customers acquired via ecosystems in 2023 more than doubled from a year ago. After the amalgamation of Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB) into DBS Bank India, we deepened customer relationships through personal loans, gold loans, MSME business loans and insurance. Through our distribution channels and partnerships, our gold loans book grew 56%. Solidifying our footprint in North Asia, we completed the integration of Citi’s consumer banking business in Taiwan in August 2023. Since then, business momentum has been strong. Within three months after the integration, more than one million Citi customers signed up for DBS digibank and Card+ apps. Putting customers at the heart of everything we do We further accelerated our transformation to a data-driven, agile organisation that puts our customers at the heart of everything we do. This new way of working, what we call Managing through Journeys (MtJs), galvanises staff to leverage our data and digital capabilities to deliver new offerings more quickly. Across our markets, we operationalised MtJs performance cells in key consumer products such as cards, consumer finance, deposits, mortgages, and customer segments.  Today, 98% of consumer banking revenue is generated by MtJs squads comprising more than 2,000 technologists, wealth managers and business teams. We scaled unsecured loans in India by leveraging pre-approved credit models and drove customer engagement through bespoke wealth content in Singapore and Taiwan. We have for many years been building and seeking to deliver best-in-class experiences to our customers. But we recognise that we can always do better to continue earning the privilege to be our customers’ primary financial partner. We will continue to innovate and enhance our services to serve our customers’ banking, payment, investing and financial planning needs across our digital and physical touchpoints, anytime and from anywhere. Standing by our customers and the community Amid the rising cost of living and an uncertain macro-outlook, we want to do what we can to stand by our customers, especially those facing acute financial stress, and help them tide over tough times. That is why DBS/ POSB committed SGD 40 million in 2023 to intensify efforts to help Singaporeans and residents ease cost-of-living pressures. The support measures helped to defray everyday expenses, reduce mortgage payments and bolster savings. We recently extended our weekly hawker meal subsidy initiative for another six months, subsidising a total of 7.5 million hawker meals over 18 months from February 2023 to July 2024.These efforts have been in addition to the bank’s commitment of up to SGD 1 billion over the next 10 years to step up support for vulnerable communities and catalyse social impact.   To protect our customers from falling prey to fraud, we also rolled out new security measures that can thwart malware threats and enable customers to lock up their accounts. Education also plays a big role. Our employees and ecosystem partners such as the Singapore Police Force worked together via digital literacy workshops and content to teach customers how to prevent fraud. What we look forward to Generating meaningful and enduring impact is a key business imperative. The success of our franchise is tied to how best we can tap our technology, assets and people to create innovative solutions and opportunities for all, including those with the fewest resources, to help them achieve their aspirations. We seek to better support our customers so we can confidently navigate the uncertainties ahead together and drive more inclusive growth.

Under the two-year support initiative, we contributed SGD 1 million, which includes the government’s dollar-for-dollar matching, to the Digital for Life movement and stepped up our volunteer participation to jointly launch community programmes and organise workshops to raise digital and financial literacy. • Through our People of Purpose movement, our employee volunteers have been running workshops that will reach 100,000 Singaporeans and residents across various community segments, such as youths, persons with disabilities, seniors and hawkers over the next two years. • In 2023, we reached out to 59,000  participants via some 400 digital and financial literacy workshops or initiatives. Neighbours ȴ rst, bankers second Since our founding in 1877, we have stayed true to our mission of being the “People’s Bank”. We take pride in serving generations of Singaporeans, from creating a nationwide savings movement, to playing a key role in the development of Singapore, and in recent years, driving digital literacy in the community. Till today, our aim as Singapore’s oldest and most loved bank is to always be at the forefront of providing pioneering ȴ nancial solutions that cater to the evolving needs of Singaporeans. They include children, young adults, families, seniors and the community at large. We remain committed to giving back to the community and standing alongside Singaporeans, as we widen our reach to more vulnerable segments through various initiatives. 630045_DBS_AR23_Front Section_p001-041_RG4.indd   40 22/2/24   1:03 PM POSB: Highlights in 2023 For children and families POSB Smart Buddy Programme • We made good progress in extending the world’s first integrated in-school savings and payments programme to more schools. The POSB Smart Buddy programme, which was launched in 2017, creates a contactless payments ecosystem within the school environment to help cultivate sensible savings and spending habits among young students in an interactive, engaging manner. These students are then better equipped to achieve financial wellness when they transition to the next stage of their lives. • We signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry of Education (MOE) to install a digital payment infrastructure in more than 330  primary and secondary schools, junior colleges/ Millennia Institute, and special education (SPED) schools by 2025. Under the partnership, we will also provide up to 400,000 students with smartwatches and cards for payments. • Today, some 160,000 students in 170 schools are using Smart Buddy smartwatches and/ or smart cards for digital payments, up from the 70,000  students across 100 schools in 2022. The programme also supports needy students under the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme. To date, the number of students who are receiving meal subsidies via POSB Smart Buddy has nearly tripled to 17,000  students. • To spark children’s interest in financial literacy, we partnered visual education specialist Eyeyah! to curate an exhibition using animation and life-sized ATMs to bring to life concepts of saving and thrifting. The exhibition drew more than 770,000  visitors across schools, libraries and public fairs. • As part of the bank’s support measures to help ease cost-of-living pressures, we also provided school allowance subsidies of up to SGD 2 a week to 21,000  eligible students in 2023. POSB PAssion Run for Kids • Singapore’s longest-running race of its kind returned in full force in 2023 with over 9,000  participants. Jointly organised by POSB and the People’s Association (PA), the event is the largest charity kids run in Singapore. • The event raised a record SGD 1.24 million  for the POSB PAssion Kids Fund this year. In all, we have raised close to SGD 13 million , with more than 869,000  children benefitting from 229 programmes .

To deepen our engagement with them, we also organised digital literacy workshops for more than 5,000 migrant workers. Today, 75%  of migrant workers and foreign domestic workers use the POSB digibank app to conduct their banking transactions. For the students, working adults and migrant workers • We stepped up our digital literacy programmes for seniors in the community. We extended these programmes to hawker centres and also created a new anti-scam and cybersecurity quiz that was co-developed with the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore and IMDA. • In partnership with DBS Foundation and IMDA, we pioneered a new series of edutainment roadshows which incorporated digital literacy workshops with Getai entertainment to better reach out to the seniors and enhance their learning. • Besides deepening collaborations  with agencies such as IMDA, RSVP SG, the Council for Third Age and PA, we worked with new partners such as TOUCH Community Services to empower more seniors.

Such assets are internally de ΋ ned under the governance of the relevant oversight committees, taking into account the asset class, issuer type and credit rating, among other criteria, before they are re Ό ected as available funds through cash Ό ow maturity mismatch analysis. DBS’ Treasury function expects to be able to operationally monetise our pool of liquid assets to meet liquidity shortfalls when the need arises. These liquid assets must be unencumbered and free of any legal, regulatory, contractual or other restrictions.In practice, liquid assets are maintained in key locations and currencies to ensure that operating entities in such locations p ossess a degree of self-su ΍  ciency to support business needs and guard against contingencies. The main portion of our liquid assets is centrally maintained in Singapore to support liquidity needs in smaller overseas subsidiaries and branches. Internally, DBS sets a requirement to maint ain its pool of liquid assets above a minimum level as a source of contingent funds, taking into account regulatory recommended liquid asset le vels as well as internally projected stress shortfalls under the cash Ό ow maturity mismatch analysis.

Group LCR has been maintained well above the minimum LCR requirements of 100% for both all-currency and SGD. DBS’ LCR is sensitive to balance sheet movements resulting from commercial loan/ deposit activities, wholesale inter-bank lending/ borrowing, and to the maturity tenor changes of these positions as they fall into or out of the LCR 30-day tenor. In order to meet the LCR requirements, DBS holds a pool of unencumbered High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) comprising predominantly cash, balances with central banks and highly rated bonds issued by governments or supranational entities. 7.5  Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) DBS is subject to the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) under MAS Notice to Banks No. 652 “Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)” (MAS Notice 652). Group NSFR has been maintained consistently above the minimum regulatory requirement of 100%. NSFR aims to improve the resiliency of banks by promoting long term funding stability.

Process Our capital management objective is implemented via a capital management and planning process that is overseen by the Capital Committee. The Chief Financial O ΍  cer chairs the Capital Committee. The Capital Committee receives regular updates on our current and projected capital position. A key tool for capital planning is the annual Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) through which we assess our projected capital supply and demand relative to regulatory requirements and capital targets. The ICAAP generally has a three-year horizon and covers various scenarios, including stress scenarios of diΊ ering scope and severity. Capital capacity is allocated on two dimensions: by business line and by entity. Capital allocations by business line are set as part of the budget process and monitored during the year. Return on regulatory capital is one of several metrics used to measure business performance. Capital allocations by entity seek to optimise the distribution of capital resources across entities, taking into account the capital adequacy requirements imposed on each subsidiary in its respective jurisdiction. Capital is allocated to ensure that each subsidiary is able to comply with regulatory requirements as it executes its business strategy in line with our strategy.During the course of the year, these subsidiaries did not experience any impediments to the distribution of dividends.Capital structure We manage our capital structure in line with our capital management objective and seek to optimise the cost and Ό exibility oΊ ered by various capital resources. In order to achieve this, we assess the need and the opportunity to raise or retire capital. The following capital transactions were undertaken during the year. • DBS Group Holdings Ltd, on 20 January 2023, redeemed SGD 250 million 3.80% Subordinated Notes. • DBS Group Holdings Ltd, on 16 March 2023, redeemed AUD 750 million Floating Rate Subordinated Notes. • DBS Group Holdings Ltd, on 11 April 2023, redeemed EUR 600 million 1.50% Subordinated Notes. • DBS Group Holdings Ltd, on 15 May 2023, redeemed CNY 950 million 5.25% Subordinated Notes. • DBS Group Holdings Ltd, on 25 June 2023, redeemed JPY 7,300 million 0.85% Subordinated Notes. • DBS Group Holdings Ltd, on 11 December 2023, redeemed USD 750 million 4.52% Subordinated Notes.

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“Basel Committee”) expects jurisdictions to implement the    countercyclical bu ΍ er during periods of excessive credit growth. Of the jurisdictions where we have material private sector credit exposures, Hong Kong has applied a countercyclical bu ΍ er of 2.5% from 1 January 2019, reducing to 2.0% from 14 October 2019 and 1.0% from 16 March 2020, and remained unchanged thereafter. The MAS has designated DBS Bank as a domestic systemically important bank (“D-SIB”). Under the MAS’ framework for identifying a nd supervising D-SIBs, the higher loss absorbency requirement for locally incorporated D-SIBs is met by the foregoing minimum ratios being two percentage points higher than those established by the Basel Committee. The Basel Committee has developed an indicator-based me thodology for identifying global systemically important banks (“G-SIBs”) on which higher loss absorbency requirements will be imposed.

An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the consolidated ȴ nancial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in ȵ uence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the consolidated ȴ nancial statements. Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall group materiality for the consolidated ȴ nancial statements as a whole, as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the e ΍ ect of misstatements, both individually and on the ȴ nancial statements as a whole. In performing our audit, we allocated materiality levels to the signi ȴ cant components and other components of the Group. These are less than the overall Group materiality. How we determined overall Group materiality 5% of the Group’s pro ȴ t before tax Rationale for benchmark applied • We chose ‘pro ȴ t before tax’ as, in our view, it is the benchmark against which performance of the Group is most commonly measured. • We selected 5% based on our professional judgement, noting that it is also within the range of commonly accepted pro ȴ t-related thresholds.Materiality• We determined the overall Group materiality based on 5% of the Group’s pro ȴ t before tax.Group scoping• Full scope audit procedures were performed over the Singapore Operations of DBS Bank Ltd. and DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited (“signiȴ cant components”). • We identi ȴ ed as component entities (“other components”) the branches of DBS Bank Ltd. Hong Kong, Taipei and London, as well as the subsidiaries DBS Bank (China) Limited, PT Bank DBS Indonesia, DBS Bank (Taiwan) Ltd and DBS Bank India Limited. This is where certain account balances were considered to be signi ȴ cant in size in relation to the Group. Consequently, audit speci ȴ ed procedures for the signi ȴ cant account balances of these components were performed to obtain su ɝ  cient and appropriate audit evidence. 115 Independent auditor’s report 630045_DBS_AR23_Financial_p110-187_RG1.indd   115 21/2/24   5:32 PM\nHow we developed the audit scopeWe tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform su ɝ  cient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the ȴ nancial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group oper ates. The Group’s ȴ nancial reporting process is dependent on its Information Technology (“IT”) systems. Our audit scope included testing the oper ating e΍ ectiveness of the controls over the integrity of key ȴ nancial data processed through the IT systems that are relevant to ȴ nancial reporting. In establishing the overall Group audit approach, we determined the extent of audit procedures that were needed to be performed  across the Group by us or by other PwC network ȴ rms, operating under our instruction, who are familiar with the local laws and regulations in each respective territory, (the “component auditors”). Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the le vel of involvement we needed to have in the procedures to be able to conclude whether su ɝ  cient and appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the ȴ nancial statements as a whole. Key audit mattersKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most signi ȴ cance in our audit of the ȴ nancial statements for the ȴ nancial year ended 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the ȴ nancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Speciȴ  c allowances for loans and advances to customers As at 31 December 2023, the speci ȴ c allowances for loans and advances to customers of the Group was $2,347 million, the majority of which related to Institutional Banking Group (“IBG”) customers. Speci ȴ c allowances refer to loss allowances for credit-impaired exposures (i.e. Stage 3, per SFRS (I) 9). Expected Credit Losses (“ECL”) on non-impaired exposures (i.e. Stage 1 and Stage 2) are set out under the ‘General allowances for credit losses’ key audit matter.We focused on this area because management assessment of impairment can be inherently subjective and involves signi ȴ cant judgement over both the timing and estimation of the size of such impairment. This includes:• principal assumptions underlying the calculation of speci ȴ c allowances for loans and advances to IBG customers where there is evidence of impairment losses (including future pro ȴ tability of borrowers and expected realisable value of collateral held); and • classiȴ cation of loans and advances in line with MAS Notice 612 (“MAS 612”).

This included, where relevant, how forbearance had been considered.Where impairment had been identi ȴ ed, for a sample of loans and advances, our work included:• considering the latest developments in relation to the borrower; • examining the forecasts of future cash ȵ ows prepared by management, including key assumptions in relation to the amount and timing of recoveries; • comparing the collateral valuation and other sources of repayment to check the calculation of the impairment against external evidence, where available, including independent valuation reports; • challenging management’s assumptions; and • testing the calculations. For a sample of performing loans and advances to IBG customers which had not been identi ȴ ed by management as potentially impaired, we evaluated management’s assumptions on their classi ȴ cation, using external evidence where available in respect of the relevant borrower.Based on procedures performed, we assessed that the aggregate speci ȴ c allowance for loans and advances is appropriate.116 DBS ANNUAL REPORT 2023       BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE ADVANTAGE 630045_DBS_AR23_Financial_p110-187_RG1.indd   116 21/2/24   5:32 PMKey audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter General allowances for credit losses (Stage 1 and 2 Expected Credit Loss)SFRS(I) 9 Financial Instruments (“SFRS(I) 9”) requires an ECL impairment model which takes into account forward-looking information to re ȵ ect potential future economic events.

We determined that we could rely on these controls for the purposes ofbour audit. The Group’s internal experts continue to perform independent model validation of selected aspects of the Group’s ECL methodologies and assumptions each year. We checked their results as part of our work.We also reviewed the ECL of selected credit portfolios to assess if the methodologies and estimates are appropriate. Through the course of our work, we assessed the rationale and calculation basis of post-model adjustments. We also assessed the reasonableness of certain forward-looking economic inputs, as well as the overall ECL output.Overall, we concluded that the Group’s ECL on non-impaired exposures isbappropriate. GoodwillAs at 31 December 2023, the Group had $6,081 million of goodwill as a result of acquisitions. We focused on this area as management makes signi ȴ cant judgements in estimating future cash ȵ ows when undertaking its annual goodwill impairment assessment.The key assumptions used in the discounted cash ȵ ow analyses relate to: • cash ȵ ow forecasts; • discount rate; and • long-term growth rate. (Refer also to Notes 3 and 27 to the ȴ nancial statements.)For goodwill balances, we assessed the appropriateness of management’s identiȴ cation of the Group’s cash generating units and the process by which indicators of impairment were identi ȴ ed. For DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited’s franchise (goodwill of $4,631 million as at 31 December 2023), we evaluated management’s cash ȵ ow forecasts and the process by which they were developed. Together with valuation specialists in our team, we assessed discount rate and growth rate assumptions against the Group’s own historical performance and available external industry and economic indicators. We checked management’s sensitivity analysis over the key assumptions to determine whether any reasonably possible change in these assumptions would result in an impairment, and also performed our own stress analysis. We concur with management’s assessment that goodwill balances are not impaired as at 31 December 2023. 117 Independent auditor’s report 630045_DBS_AR23_Financial_p110-187_RG1.indd   117 21/2/24   5:32 PM\nKey audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Valuation of ȴ  nancial instruments held at fair value Financial instruments held by the Group at fair value include derivative assets and liabilities, trading securities, certain debt instruments and other assets and liabilities designated at fair value.The Group’s ȴ nancial instruments are predominantly valued using quoted market prices (‘Level 1’) or market observable prices (‘Level 2’).

The consolidated ȴ nancial statements for the year ended 31bDecember 2023 were authorised for issue by the Directors onb6bFebruary 2024. 1.   Domicile and Activities The Company, DBS Group Holdings Ltd, is incorporated and domiciled in the Republic of Singapore and has its registered o ɝ  ce at 12 Marina Boulevard, Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower Three, Singapore 018982.The Company is listed on the Singapore Exchange.The Company is an investment holding, treasury and funding vehicle for the group. Its main subsidiary is DBS Bank Ltd. (the Bank), which is wholly owned and engaged in a range of commercial banking and ȴ nancial services, principally in Asia. The ȴ nancial statements relate to the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group) and the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures. 2.     Summary of Material Accounting Policies 2.1  Basis of preparation Compliance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I))The ȴ nancial statements of the Company and the consolidated ȴ nancial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I)). As permitted by Section 201(10)(b) of the Companies Act 1967 (the Act), the Company’s income statement has not been included in these ȴ nancial statements. The ȴ nancial statements are presented in Singapore dollars and rounded to the nearest million, unless otherwise stated. 2.2  Signi ȴ cant estimates and judgement The preparation of ȴ nancial statements requires management to exercise judgement, use estimates and make assumptions in the application of policies and in reporting the amounts in the ȴ nancial statements. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may di΍ er from these estimates. Critical accounting estimates and assumptions used that are signi ȴ cant to the ȴ nancial statements, and areas involving a higher degr ee of judgement and complexity, arebdisclosed in Note 3.2.3   New or amended SFRS(I) e ΍ ective for 2023 year-end The Group has adopted International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules (Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-12) upon its issuance in May 2023. The amendments provide a temporary mandatory exception from deferred tax accounting arising from the implementation of Pillar Two model rules which is e ΍ ective immediately, and also require newbdisclosures on the Pillar Two exposure. The other amendments to SFRS(I) that were e ΍ ective from 1 January 2023 did not have a signi ȴ cant impact on the Group’s ȴ nancial statements. 2.4   New SFRS(I) and Interpretations e ΍ ective for future periods The amendments and interpretations e ΍ ective for future periods dobnot have a signi ȴ cant impact on the Group’s ȴ nancial statements. A)  General Accounting Policies A summary of the Group’s material accounting policies is described further below starting with those relating to the entire ȴ nancial statements, followed by those relating to the income statement, thebbalance sheet and other speci ȴ c topics. This does not re ȵ ect thebrelative importance of these policies to the Group. 2.5   Group Accounting SubsidiariesSubsidiaries are entities (including structured entities) over which thebGroup has control. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to a ΍ ect those returns through its power over the entity.Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control is transferred tobthe Group to the date control ceases. The acquisition method is used to account for business combinations. Please refer to Note 2.13 for the Group’s accounting policy on goodwill.All intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation. Associates and Joint Ventures Associates are entities over which the Group has signi ȴ cant inȵ uence but no control, where the Group generally holds a shareholding of between and including 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Joint ventures are entities which the Group has joint control and rights to the net assets of the entity.126 DBS ANNUAL REPORT 2023       BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE ADVANTAGE 630045_DBS_AR23_Financial_p110-187_RG1.indd   126 21/2/24   5:32 PMInvestments in associates and joint ventures are initially recognised at cost. In addition, when the Group’s share of the fair value of the identi ȴ able net assets of the investment exceeds the cost of acquisition paid by the Group, the excess is recognised in pro ȴ t and loss as part of the share of pro ȴ t from associates and joint ventures. Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, these investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of post-acquisition pro ȴ ts or losses and the Group’s share of other comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from the associates and joint ventures are recognised as a reduction of the carrying amount of the investments. 2.6   Foreign currency treatment Functional and presentation currencyItems in the ȴ nancial statements are measured using the functional currency of each entity in the Group, this being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The Group’s ȴ nancial statements are presented in Singapore dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company. Foreign currency transactions and balancesTransactions in foreign currencies are measured using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the entity undertaking the transaction at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange di ΍ erences arising from this translation are recognised in the income statement within “Net trading income”. Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair values in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair values are determined, which is generally the balance sheet date. Unrealised foreign exchange di ΍ erences arising from non-monetary ȴ nancial assets and liabilities classi ȴ ed as fair value through pro ȴ t or loss (FVPL) are recognised in the income statement as trading income. Non-monetary ȴ nancial assets that are classi ȴ ed at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) relates mainly to FVOCI equities. Please refer to Note 2.9 for the accounting treatment of FVOCI equities. Foreign operationsThe results and ȴ nancial position of subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures and branches or units whose functional currency is not Singapore dollars (“foreign operations”) are translated into Singapore dollars in the following manner: • Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date; • Income and expenses in the income statement are translated at exchange rates prevailing at each month-end, approximating the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions; and • All resulting exchange di ΍ erences are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated under foreign currency translation reserves in equity. When a foreign operation is partially or fully disposed of, or when it is liquidated, such exchange di ΍ erences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss. For acquisitions prior to 1 January 2005, the foreign exchange rates at the respective dates of acquisition were used. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation on or after 1 January 2005 are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate. Please refer to Note 27 for an overview of goodwill recorded. 2.7  Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to management. In preparing the segment information, amounts for each business segment are shown after the allocation of certain centralised costs, funding income and the application of transfer pricing, where appropriate. Transactions between segments are recorded within the segment as if they are third party transactions and are eliminated on consolidation. Please refer to Note 45 for further details on business and geographical segment reporting.127", "bank": "DBS", "year": "2023"}

Interest income and interest expense are recognised on a time-proportionate basis using the e ΍ ective interest method. The calculation includes signi ȴ cant fees and transaction costs that are integral to the e ΍ ective interest rate, as well as premiums or discounts. Net interest income also includes the interest element of derivative instruments that are (i) designated in hedge accounting relationships (Note 2.19) or (ii) used in funding or other hedging arrangements where this treatment would reduce an accounting mismatch.Fee and commission incomeThe Group earns fee and commission income from a diverse range of products and services provided to its customers. Fee and commission income are recognised when the Group has satis ȴ ed its performance obligation in providing the promised products and services to the customer, and are recognised based on contractual rates agreed with customers, net of expected waivers based on historical experience, and net of expenses directly related to it. The Group generally satis ȴ es its performance obligation and recognises the fee and commission income on the following basis:• Transaction-based fee and commission income is recognised on the completion of the transaction. Such fees include underwriting fees, brokerage fees, bancassurance sales commission and variable service fees, and fees related to the completion of corporate ȴ nance transactions. • For a service that is provided over a period of time, fee and commission income is generally recognised on equal proportion basis over the period during which the related service is provided or credit", "bank": "DBS", "year": "2023"}

Directly related expenses typically include brokerage fees paid, card-related expenses and sales commissions, but do not include expenses for services delivered over a period (such as service contracts) and other expenses that are not speciȴ cally related to fee band commission income transactions.

When the Group acts as a trustee or in a ȴ duciary capacity for assets it does not directly control or bene ȴ t from, the assets and the corresponding income belonging to a customer are excluded from the ȴ nancial statements. Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value, which is generally the transaction price.Classiȴ cation and subsequent measurement SFRS(I) 9 categorises debt-like ȴ nancial assets based on the business model within which the assets are managed, and whether the assets constitute a “basic lending arrangement” where their contractual cash ȵ ows represent solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI).

The objective of a HTC business model is to collect contractual principal and interest cash ȵ  ows. Sales are incidental to the objective and expected to be either insigni ȴ cant or infrequent.

Both the collection of contractual cash ȵ ows and sales are integral to achieving the objective of the HTC & S business model. Assets measured at FVOCI comprise mainly of debt securities from “Treasury Markets” and the “Others” segment.Unrealised gains or losses on FVOCI debt instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income and accumulated in FVOCI revaluation reserves. When they are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments in FVOCI revaluation reserves are reclassiȴ ed to the income statement as “Net income from investment securities”. • Debt instruments are measured at fair value through pro ȴ t orbloss  (FVPL) when: i) the assets are not SPPI in nature;ii) the assets are not part of a “HTC” or “HTC & S” business model; oriii)  the assets are designated at FVPL to eliminate or signi ȴ cantly reduce the measurement or recognition inconsistencies that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities on di΍ erent bases. Assets measured at FVPL are mainly recorded in the “Treasury Markets” segment. Realised and unrealised gains or losses on FVPL ȴ nancial assets are taken to the income statement in the period they arise.128 DBS ANNUAL REPORT 2023       BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE ADVANTAGE 630045_DBS_AR23_Financial_p110-187_RG1.indd   128 21/2/24   5:32 PM• Subsequent changes in fair value of non-trading equity instruments can be taken through pro ȴ t or loss or comprehensive income, as elected.

Other than dividend income, gains and losses on FVOCI equity instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income and accumulated in FVOCI revaluation reserves, and not reclassi ȴ ed to pro ȴ t or loss upon derecognition. • Derivatives (including derivatives embedded in ȴ nancial liabilities but separated for accounting purposes) are classi ȴ ed as held for trading unless they are designated in hedge accounting relationships (Note 2.19). Derivatives are classi ȴ ed as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. Changes in the fair value of derivatives other than those designated as hedging instruments in cash ȵ ow or net investment hedges are included in “Net trading income”. Also refer to Note 2.8 on the accounting for thebinterest element of derivative instruments. Reclassi ȴ cation Reclassiȴ cation of ȴ nancial assets are prohibited unless the Group changes its business model for managing ȴ nancial assets. In practice, this is expected to be infrequent.Determination of fair valueThe fair value of ȴ nancial assets is the price that would be received if the asset is sold in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is generally estimated by using prices in active markets or by using valuation techniques that use observable market parameters as inputs.Where applicable, a valuation reserve or pricing adjustment is applied to arrive at the fair value. Signi ȴ cant judgement is required inbestimating fair value. Refer to Note 41 for further details.

Stage 3 ȴ nancial assets are written-o ΍ , in whole or in part, when the Group has exhausted all practical recovery e ΍ orts and has concluded that there is no reasonable expectation of future recoveries. Measurement of ECLECL are unbiased and probability-weighted estimates of credit losses determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, considering past events, current conditions and assessments of future economic conditions at the reporting date. The ECL associated with a ȴ nancial instrument is typically a product of its probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD) discounted using the original e ΍ ective interest rate to the reporting date. Component Description PD Point-in-time (based on current conditions, adjusted to take into account estimates of future conditions that will impact PD) estimate of the likelihood of default. LGD Estimate of the loss arising on default. It is based on the di΍ erence between the contractual cash ȵ ows due and those that the Group would expect to receive, including recoveries from collaterals. EAD Estimate of the expected credit exposure at time of default, taking into account repayments of principal and interest as well as expected drawdowns on undrawn credit commitments and potential pay-outs onbguarantees issued. The 12-month ECL is calculated by multiplying the 12-month PD, LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL is calculated by multiplying the lifetime PD, LGD and EAD. The 12-month and lifetime PDs represent the probability of default occurring over the next 12 months and the remaining maturity of the instrument respectively.In most instances, expected remaining maturity is the same as the remaining contractual life which represents the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to the credit", "bank": "DBS", "year": "2023"}

LGDs are determined using historical loss data, which are adjusted for both the latest and forecasted recovery experience. The Group relies on a Monte Carlo simulation approach to consider over 100 probability-weighted forward-looking scenarios in estimating ECL. This involves simulations of many alternative CCI scenarios to arrive at an unbiased ECL estimate that are meant to cover all possible good and bad scenarios based on known estimates. For material unsecured retail portfolios under the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based Approach (Advanced IRBA), the Group has rolled out a SFRS(I) 9 adjusted PD, LGD and EAD-based approach during the year. For other retail portfolios, historical loss experience is used in conjunction with the forecast loss rates which take into account relevant macroeconomic variables, such as property prices and unemployment rates.Expert credit judgement and post model adjustmentsThe measurement of ECL requires the application of expert credit judgement and post model adjustments.

Goodwill is stated at cost less impairment losses and is tested at least annually for impairment. At the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each of the cash-generating units (CGU) or group of CGUs expected to beneȴ  t from the combination’s synergies. An impairment loss is recognised on goodwill when the carrying amount of a CGU, or group of CGUs, including the goodwill, exceeds the applicable recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of a CGU or CGU group is the higher of the CGU’s or CGU group’s fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. An impairment loss on goodwill is recognised in the income statement and cannot be reversed in subsequent periods. Other intangible assetsIntangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and they relate mainly to customer relationships and core customer deposits. They have a ȴ nite useful life and are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. bIntangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 10 years. 2.14  Properties and other ȴ xed assets Owned properties and other ȴ xed assets Properties (including investment properties) and other ȴ xed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to write down the costs of the assets to their residual values over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful life refers to the period which the Group expects to use or hold the asset. The residual value of an asset is its estimated selling price (after deducting related costs), assuming that it is already at the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life. No depreciation is recognised when the residual value is higher than the carrying amount.Freehold and leasehold land with unexpired lease terms of more than 100 years are not depreciated. The depreciation periods of the other assets are as follows:Leasehold land with The shorter of the remaining lease termunexpired lease terms or useful lifebelow 100 years Buildings  The shorter of 50 years, the remaining lease term or useful life Computer software 3 to 5 yearsComputer hardware,  3 to 10 yearsoɝ  ce equipment, furniture and ȴ ttings Leasehold improvements Up to 20 yearsLeased properties and other ȴ xed assets Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term at the lease commencement date. The measurement of the associated right-of-use assets generally approximates the lease liability. Lease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the e ΍ ective interest method. The right-of-use assets are depreciated over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Extension options and termination options are included in the assessment of the lease term if the options are reasonably certain tobbe exercised or not exercised accordingly. If the Group changes itsbinitial assessment, adjustments are made to the carrying amounts of the lease liabilities and right-of-use assets prospectively.The recognition exceptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are applied.131", "bank": "DBS", "year": "2023"}

The Group considers uncertain tax positions generally at the level of the total tax liability to each tax authority for each period. The liability is determined based on the total amount of current tax expected to be paid, taking into account all tax uncertainties, using either an expected value approach or a single best estimate of the most likely outcome. Tax assets and liabilities of the same type (current or deferred) are o΍ set when a legal right of o ΍ set exists and settlement in this manner is intended. This applies generally when they arise from the same tax reporting group and relate to the same tax authority.Deferred income tax is provided on temporary di ΍ erences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the ȴ nancial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax is also not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, a΍ ects neither accounting nor taxable pro ȴ t or loss and does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary di ΍ erences. Thebamount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.The amount of deferred tax assets recognised takes into account theblikelihood the amount that can be used to o ΍ set payable taxes on future pro ȴ ts. Deferred tax related to fair value re-measurement of FVOCI investments is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the FVOCI revaluation reserves. 3.   Critical Accounting Estimates The Group’s accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to the reported amounts in the ȴ nancial statements. Certain accounting estimates require management’s judgement in determining the appropriate methodology for valuation of assets and liabilities. Procedures are in place to ensure that methodologies are reviewed and revised as appropriate. The Group believes its estimates for determining the valuation of its assets and liabilities are appropriate.The following is a brief description of the Group’s critical accounting estimates that involve management’s valuation judgement. 3.1   Impairment of ȴ nancial assets It is the Group’s policy to recognise, through charges against pro ȴ t, allowances in respect of estimated and inherent credit losses in its portfolio as described in Note 2.11.ECLs are unbiased and probability-weighted estimates of credit losses determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, considering past events, current conditions and assessments of future economic conditions at the reporting date. This will necessarily involve the use of judgement.Please refer to", "bank": "DBS", "year": "2023"}

Please refer to Note 41 for further details on fair valuation and fair value hierarchy of the Group’s ȴ nancial instruments measured at fair value. 3.3  Goodwill impairment The Group performs an impairment review to ensure that the carrying amount of a CGU to which goodwill is allocated does not exceed the recoverable amount of the CGU. Note 27 provides details of goodwill at bthe reporting date. The recoverable amount represents the present value of the estimated future cash ȵ ows expected to arise from continuing operations. Therefore, in arriving at the recoverable amount, management exercises judgement in estimating the future cash ȵ ows, growth rate and discount rate. 3.4  Income taxes The Group has exposure to income taxes in several jurisdictions. The Group recognises liabilities for expected tax issues based on reasonable estimate of whether additional tax will be due. Where uncertainty exists around the Group’s tax position, appropriate provisions are provided based on the technical assessment of the cases. Where the ȴ nal tax outcome of these positions is di ΍ erent from the provision provided, the di ΍ erences will impact the income tax and deferred tax balances in the period in which the ȴ nal tax is determined. Note 21 provides details of the Group’s deferred tax assets/ liabilities. 134 DBS ANNUAL REPORT 2023       BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE ADVANTAGE 630045_DBS_AR23_Financial_p110-187_RG1.indd   134 21/2/24   5:32 PM8.

In the Singapore 2023 Budget Statement, the Singapore government announced plans to implement the GloBE ru les as well as a domestic top-up tax (DTT) beginning on or after 1 January 2025. Since the Pillar Two legislation has not been enacted  in Singapore, the jurisdiction in which DBS Group Holdings Ltd is incorporated, and is thus not e ΍ ective at the reporting date, the Group has no related current tax exposure. The Group has applied the exception to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabi lities related to Pillar Two income taxes, as provided in the amendments to SFRS(I) 1-12 International Tax Reform—Pillar Two Model Rules  issued in May 2023. Under the GloBE model rules, the GloBE e ΍ ective tax rate (ETR) is assessed on a jurisdictional basis and top up tax is payable if the jurisdictional ETR is below 15%. The GloBE ETR is not exactly the same as accounting ETR. However, if the accounting ETR were to be used to assess  the potential GloBE implications, DBS entities in most jurisdictions are operating with an average accounting ETR that exceeds 15%, except fo r Singapore, Macau, Malaysia and United Arab Emirates (UAE). Please refer to the geographical segment information in Note 45.2 for details o n Singapore’s accounting pro ȴ ts and tax expenses. As of the issuance date of these ȴ nancial statements, Singapore has not announced when and how the GloBE rules will be enacted. Consequently, it is not presently feasible to reasonably estimate the quantitative impact of this legislation. The Group is actively engaged in evaluating its potential exposure to these forthcoming regulations. The impact of Pillar Two for Macau, Malaysia and bUAE is expected to be immaterial.Japan, South Korea, United Kingdom and Vietnam have respectively either announced draft legislations or enacted legislations to  implement Pillar Two in 2024. The average accounting ETRs of the DBS entities operating in these jurisdictions are above 15%, without con sidering the various elections available and adjustments required under the GloBE model rules. While the exact quantitative impact cannot be  reasonably estimated as yet due to the complexities in applying the legislations, the impact of Pillar Two is expected to be immaterial.146 DBS ANNUAL REPORT 2023       BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE ADVANTAGE 630045_DBS_AR23_Financial_p110-187_RG1.indd   146 21/2/24   5:32 PM22.

The acquisition is in line wit h the Group’s strategy to scale up its investment and accelerates its expansion in Taiwan. The Group has paid a cash consideration of $936 million for the assets acquired (comprising mainly foreign currency cash accoun ts and loans and advances) of $12.6 billion and the liabilities assumed (comprising mainly deposits and balances with customers and pension liabilities) of $12.4 billion.

The more material goodwill at the Group relates to DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited’s franchise and DBS Taiwan Consumer Banking Bus iness. Thebrecoverable value of the franchise is determined based on a value-in-use calculation. The CGU’s ȴ ve-year projected free cash ȵ ows, after taking into account the maintenance of capital adequacy requirements at target levels, are discounted by its cost of capi tal to derive itsbpresent value. To derive the value beyond the ȴ fth year, a long-term growth rate is imputed to the ȴ fth-year cash ȵ ow and then discounted bybthe cost of capital to derive the terminal value. The long-term growth rate used does not exceed the historical long-term growth rate of thebmarket the CGU operates in. The recoverable value is the sum of the present value of the ȴ ve-year cash ȵ ows and the terminal value. A growth rate of 3.5% (2022: 3.5%) and discount rate of 9.0% (2022: 9.0%) were assumed in the value-in-use calculation for DBS Bank (HongbKong) Limited’s franchise. The process of evaluating goodwill impairment involves management judgement and prudent estimates of various factors including future cash ȵ ows as well as the cost of capital and long-term growth rates. The results can be highly sensitive to the assumptions used. Ke y assumptions used to determine the recoverable amounts of the CGU, including growth rate and discount rate, are tested for sensitivity by ap plying a reasonably possible change to those assumptions. The reasonably possible changes in key assumptions did not result in an impairment of goodwill as at 31 December 2023.

Share-based Compensation Plans As part of the Group’s remuneration policy, the Group provides various share-based compensation plans to foster a culture that aligns employees’ interests with shareholders’, enable employees to share in the Group’s performance and enhance talent retention. Main Scheme/ Plan Note DBSH Share Plan (Share Plan)• The Share Plan is granted to Group executives as determined by the Compensation and Management Development Committee (“Committee”) which has been appointed to administer the Share Plan from time to time. • Participants are awarded shares of the Company or, at the Committee’s discretion, their equivalent cash value or a combination. • The share awards consist of a main award and a retention award for employees on bonus/ sales incentive plans. Dividends on unvested shares do not accrue to employees. • The Directors reviewed and approved the proposed changes to the vesting schedule and retention awards on 5bDecember 2022. These would apply to shares granted from 2023, and there are no changes to the vesting schedule andbretention awards for shares that had been granted in earlier periods: Vesting schedule• For employees on bonus plan (including key employees who are also awarded shares as part of talent retention): –  The main award granted prior to February 2023 will vest 2 to 4 years after grant i.e. 33% will vest 2 years after grant; another 33% will vest on the third year and the remaining 34% plus the retention award will vest 4 years after grant. –  The main award granted from February 2023 will vest 1 to 4 years after grant i.e. 25% will vest each year. Thebretention award will vest 4 years after grant. • Special Awards are granted as part of talent retention for selected individuals. –  Special Awards granted prior to February 2023 will vest 2 to 4 years after grant i.e. 33% will vest 2 years after grant; another 33% will vest on the third year and the remaining 34% will vest 4 years after grant. –  Special Awards granted from February 2023 will vest 1 to 3 years after grant; i.e. 33% will vest 1 year after grant, another 33% will vest on the second year and the remaining 34% will vest 3 years after grant. Retention award• For share awards granted from 2023, the retention award for employees on bonus plan was reduced from 20% to 15% following the change in the vesting schedule. • There is no retention award for Special Awards. • For employees on sales incentive plan, the main award will vest 1 to 3 years after grant; i.e. 33% will vest 1 year after grant, another 33% will vest on the second year and the remaining 34% plus the retention award will vest 3 years after grant. The retention award remains unchanged at 15%. • All the DBSH Share Plan awards will lapse immediately upon termination of employment, except in the event of ill health, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or death. • The market price of shares on the grant date is used to estimate the fair value of the shares awarded. The fair value of the shares granted includes an adjustment to exclude the present value of future expected dividends to be paid during the vesting period. • Vested and unvested shares are subject to clawback/ malus. Conditions that trigger such clawback/ malus are in the Remuneration Report section of the Annual Report. • Shares are awarded to non-executive Directors as part of director’s remuneration.

A market parameter is de ȴ ned as being signi ȴ cant when its impact on the Day 1 P&L is greater than an internally determined threshold. The Day 1 P&L reserve is released to the income statement when the parameters become observable or when the transaction is closed out or amortised over the duration of the transaction. At year end, the unamortised Day 1 P&L was not material.Bid-O΍ er Adjustments The Group often holds, at varying points in time, both long or shortbpositions in ȴ nancial instruments which are valued using mid- market levels. Bid-o ΍ er adjustments are then made to account for close-out costs. 41.2  Fair Value Hierarchy The fair value hierarchy accords the highest level to observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest level to unobservable inputs. The fair value measurement of each ȴ nancial instrument is categorised in accordance with the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the input with the lowest level that is signi ȴ cant to the entire measurement. If unobservable inputs are deemed signi ȴ cant, the ȴ nancial instrument will be categorised as Level 3.Financial instruments that are valued using quoted prices in active markets are classi ȴ ed as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. These would include government and sovere ign securities, listed equities and corporate debt securities which are actively traded. Derivatives contracts which are traded in an active exchange market are also classiȴ ed as Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Where fair value is determined using quoted market prices in less active markets or quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities, such instruments are generally classi ȴ ed as Level 2. In cases where quoted prices are generally not available, the Group will determine the fair value based on valuation techniques that use market parameters as inputs including but not limited to yield curves, volatilities and foreign exchange rates. The majority of valuation techniques employ only observable market data so that reliability of the fair value measurement is high. These would include corporate debt securities, repurchase, reverse repurchase agreements and most of the Group’s over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. The Group classi ȴ es ȴ nancial instruments as Level 3 when there is reliance on unobservable market parameters whether used directly to value a ȴ nancial asset or liability, or used as inputs to a valuation model, attributing to a signi ȴ cant contribution to the instrument value. These would include all input parameters which are derived from historical data, for example, asset correlations or certain volatilities. Level 3 instruments also include unquoted equity securities which are measured based on the net asset value of the investments. In addition, Level 3 inputs include all stale quoted security prices and other approximations (e.g. bonds valued using credit default swap spreads). 166 DBS ANNUAL REPORT 2023       BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE ADVANTAGE 630045_DBS_AR23_Financial_p110-187_RG1.indd   166 21/2/24   5:32 PMThe following tables present assets and liabilities measured at fair value, classi ȴ ed by level within the fair value hierarchy.
