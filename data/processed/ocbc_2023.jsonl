Very few banks in this region can rival us in the diversity and inter-connectedness of our franchise, developed through both organic and inorganic growth over the decades. We are uniquely a financial group that possesses a remarkably comprehensive banking, wealth management, insurance and asset management franchise which clearly differentiates us from our peers, in both structure and capabilities. We have a standalone leading private bank in Asia, Bank of Singapore; the oldest and most established life insurance group in Singapore and Malaysia in Great Eastern Holdings; and one of the largest asset managers in Southeast Asia, Lion Global Investors. We have also a sizeable stake in our associate, Bank of Ningbo, a domestic systemically important bank in China that is ranked amongst the top 20 largest Chinese banks by assets as of June 2023. We have deep network presence in our core markets of Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Greater China. Our regional and international network has been progressively expanded beyond our core markets to support customers seeking new markets, and we will continue to explore opportunities to further our presence. We are acutely cognisant of the ongoing geopolitical and structural shifts which will substantially reshape the future operating landscape. While these present challenges, they also provide OCBC with generational opportunities to leverage on new wealth, investment and trade flows. We are well poised to support offshoring of manufacturing activities into Southeast Asia given our extensive network in this region. We are also able to capture cross-border wealth flows through both our established Private Banking hubs in Singapore, Hong Kong SAR and Dubai, and our extensive regional Wealth Management centres. It is imperative that we develop a sharp focus on how we capture these new opportunities and position OCBC for the future. In the coming years, we will work to derive more value from our market-facing franchises and build stronger operational resiliency and efficiency, all underpinned with the best-in-class technologies. This will be accompanied by a reiteration for greater internal synergies and collaboration within OCBC and with the wider Group, including Great Eastern Holdings and Lion Global Investors.

We are focused on delivering value to you as shareholders and I am pleased that we have achieved this in 2023 despite the uncertain and volatile operating environment. OCBC’s net profit of $7.02 billion in 2023 was up 27% from the previous year, reaching another record high. This lifted our return on equity from 11.1% to 13.7%. Operating performance was resilient across our key businesses, demonstrating the strength of our diversified franchise and strong progress we made in executing our corporate strategy.Let me highlight the key drivers of our 2023 earnings. Our total income was $13.5 billion, up 20% on the back of broad-based growth. Net interest income reached a new high, increasing by 25% to $9.65 billion, driven by 5% asset growth and a 37-basis point expansion in net interest margin to 2.28%. We have been proactively managing our balance sheet through selectively growing our loan portfolio and managing our funding base, which has positioned us well through the interest rate environment. Our non-interest income also increased by 7% to $3.86 billion, largely attributed to improved trading income and investment gains. Loan-related and credit card fees rose, but overall fee income was down as subdued investment sentiments among other reasons, continued to weigh on wealth-related fees. Nonetheless, our wealth management franchise was resilient, with our assets under management expanding 2% to $263 billion. Our income growth far outpaced an 8% increase in expenses, which led to an improvement in cost-to-income ratio to 38.7%. Strict cost discipline will remain a priority for us, even as we continue to invest in our franchise across products, people and technology.

{"section_title": "risks prudently. Notwithstanding the challenging business landscape, our overall loa", "content": "risks prudently. Notwithstanding the challenging business landscape, our overall loans rose 2% in constant currency terms. We sustained non-trade corporate loan growth as we supported customers across our network, such as in the technology, infrastructure, logistics and electric vehicle supply chain sectors, as well as our customers’ green transition efforts. At the same time, we expanded our housing loan portfolio in Singapore. These more than offset a decline in trade loans which reflect the current operating landscape. Our asset quality remained healthy with the non-performing loan ratio dropping to 1.0% from 1.2% a year ago. Total credit costs were at 20 basis points, mainly comprising allowances for non-impaired loans as we continued to pre-emptively set aside allowances. OCBC’s funding, liquidity, and capital ratios remained strong. Our Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Adequacy Ratio increased to 15.9% mainly attributable to profit accretion, RWA optimisation and positive movement in our fair value reserves. The movement in fair value reserves was supported by an $839 million net fair value gain on Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income financial assets, as compared to $2.42 billion of losses a year ago.

Refer to page 11 to see the growth in our net profit and dividends over the years. Strong Momentum with Our Corporate Strategy Our corporate strategy took full flight in 2023, with a strong focus on leveraging OCBC’s strengths to capitalise on the vast opportunities in Asia. The shifting dynamics of trade, investment, and wealth flows have led to a concentration of these activities within Asia. ASEAN-Greater China flows have gained prominence, driven by geopolitical tensions and the emergence of a multipolar world. Since 2019, ASEAN has surpassed the European Union to become China’s largest trading partner, with China-ASEAN bilateral trade accounting for 15% of China’s total goods trade. This is a significant figure considering the size of the Chinese economy. The rise of Asian wealth is expected to continue. Personal financial assets in Asia-Pacific are predicted to grow by an average of about 8% annually over the next five years, well above the 5% global average. There is also a notable wealth flow within Asia, as an increasing number of high-net-worth individuals seek to diversify their assets beyond their countries of residence. Key financial hubs like Singapore and Hong Kong are best placed to benefit from this trend. I firmly believe that OCBC is well positioned to seize these opportunities presented by the ASEAN-Greater China region. My conviction in this belief has only grown stronger ever since I rejoined OCBC in 2020. Inclusive of Bank of Singapore, Great Eastern Holdings and Lion Global Investors, OCBC Group has strong presence and capabilities in the top 7 ASEAN markets. Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia are our core markets in ASEAN. We have made significant moves to shore up this position in 2023. Pending regulatory approvals, OCBC Indonesia will be acquiring PT Bank Commonwealth, with more than 1 million customers to be added to our franchise as a result. Its capabilities in wealth management and auto joint financing will broaden our product offerings and diversify our customer acquisition channels. Turning to Malaysia, Great Eastern Holdings through its subsidiaries, is set to acquire AmMetLife Insurance Berhad and AmMetLife Takaful Berhad pending regulatory approvals. Again, this will expand the Group’s customer base and breadth of product offerings. We are strong in Greater China too, with more than 60 offices and branches in Mainland China, Hong Kong SAR and Macau SAR. The newest is our Wuhan branch which was opened in March 2023. Being the capital city of Hubei and one of China’s largest transport, industrial and manufacturing hubs, Wuhan serves as an effective gateway to Hubei province and the Central China region for OCBC. Complementing this strong OCBC network is our associate company Bank of Ningbo, in which we have a 20% stake. Bank of Ningbo is one of the fastest growing commercial banks in China and is one of its domestic systemically important banks. This collaboration strengthens our capabilities in China and extends our reach, allowing us to support their business customers that wish to expand into ASEAN and vice versa. Our presence in other global financial centres is also vital to what we do. OCBC has offices in London, New York, and Sydney, to support our network corporate customers in expanding and investing beyond Asia. Bank of Singapore has a presence in Dubai, London and Luxembourg as well, enabling us to serve the Middle East and Europe regions, which have the third and fourth most ultra-high-net-worth individuals respectively. The Power of One OCBC Brand With our extensive coverage, it is vital that we optimise our linkages to boost our network capabilities. This entails strengthening our collaboration across markets and entities. We must demonstrate our commitment to supporting our customers across all markets as one OCBC Group. It is also imperative that our colleagues feel a true sense of unity as one team. The result is a better pooling of our resources, enabling us to serve each and every customer across multiple countries, with more products, and in a concerted manner. In line with this objective, one strategic move made in 2023 was the launch of one OCBC brand with a refreshed logo and a new tagline – For Now, and Beyond – to unify all OCBC-branded entities. The new tagline demonstrates what OCBC has always been about – enabling people and communities to realise their aspirations today, and beyond that. I would like to thank the many colleagues across all subsidiaries, branches and offices who came together to successfully launch the refreshed logo in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Mainland China, Hong Kong SAR, Macau SAR, and overseas branches including London, Sydney, New York. The legal names in Mainland China, Hong Kong SAR and Macau SAR were also changed. In Malaysia where we have an Islamic Banking Licence, we operate with two brands – OCBC and OCBC Al Amin. 9 8\nThe One Group, One Brand approach we have created is powerful. Consider a Chinese company that is venturing into Indonesia to tap on its large young population and abundance of natural resources. OCBC is present in both Mainland China and Indonesia to provide seamless support. When Chinese companies go to Malaysia, for example Penang with its established ecosystem for higher-end manufacturing, OCBC is there as well. When companies set up bases in Singapore and Hong Kong SAR from which they expand, again OCBC is present in both locations. The owners of these businesses can be referred to OCBC Premier Banking or Premier Private Client or our private banking arm, Bank of Singapore. Everywhere these customers go, they can bank with OCBC. This exciting potential showcases the benefits of working as One Group. By leveraging our collective strengths, we can harness the synergies and deliver results beyond our individual capabilities. It is with this belief that we made a big announcement in July 2023: we said that we would aim to deliver $3 billion in incremental revenue by 2025 on top of our current growth trajectory. We are firmly on track to deliver on our goal and will intensify our efforts in 2024 and 2025. Positioning for a Sustainable Future Our", "bank": "OCBC", "year": "2023"}

We became a signatory in 2022, and less than a year later, we announced ambitious, quantitative and science-based decarbonisation targets for six sectors – Power, Oil and Gas, Real Estate, Steel, Aviation and Shipping. These represent the most greenhouse gas emission intensive sectors that we finance. We have mapped out the key actions that we will take to meet these targets and will disclose our progress as we go along. Building OCBC into a leading financial services partner for a sustainable future requires investments in our people and technology. While we watch our expenses closely, we do not shy away from making strategic investments. We will build up our talent pool of bankers and relationship managers in Greater China and ASEAN, and invest $30 million through 2025 to help employees progress in their careers and make them more resilient. Part of this has gone into building an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled career marketplace which allows employees to find opportunities within the Group and recommends relevant training courses to equip them for the new role. In 2022, we announced that we had completed Phase One of a seven-year digital core roadmap. That included a $250 million investment to accelerate digital transformation. Phase 2 is well under way, with another investment of $300 million over the period of 2023 to 2025. We are strengthening our AI architecture too, which is important given our ambitions in this space. More than 4 million decisions are made by AI daily and I expect these volumes to more than double in the next 12 to 24 months. Our experience with AI models has enabled us to move quickly in the area of generative AI. When Chat GPT took the world by storm in 2023, we became the first bank in Singapore to deploy a generative AI chatbot – OCBC GPT – to 30,000 employees globally by end 2023. Since then, I have heard so much good feedback from colleagues on productivity increases. OCBC GPT has assisted them with research, summarising of information and translation, just to name a few. We will maintain our focus on executing our corporate strategy well. Our Ambition to be Asia’s leading financial services partner for a sustainable future is a bold one. It demonstrates our determination to surpass industry standards and establish ourselves as the benchmark in our field. While doing so, we will always be anchored on reasons for OCBC’s existence. Our Purpose, which was refined in 2023, is to enable people and communities to realise their aspirations. It means that we cannot and will not just gun for profit. Our LIFRR Values – Lasting Value, Integrity, Forward-looking, Respect and Responsibility – must always guide us. Are we advising our customers out of a sense of fair dealing? Or are we hawking an unsuitable investment product for self-serving reasons? 11 10\nAre we providing the local knowledge and connections to help businesses expand into other markets?

We work as One Group to pursue strong growth across ASEAN and Greater China.Europe Middle East Banking OCBC Group’s banking entities are locally incorporated commercial banks in top economies in ASEAN, such as Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as in Greater China. We have the most comprehensive coverage across ASEAN and Greater China enabling us to serve the banking needs and enable the aspirations of businesses and individuals. Through these banking subsidiaries, we have more than 330 branches and offices in ASEAN’s leading economies of Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, and more than 60 in Mainland China, Hong Kong SAR and Macau SAR. This includes Bank of Singapore, our private banking subsidiary. Besides our banking subsidiaries, our capabilities in Mainland China are strengthened significantly due to our associate company Bank of Ningbo which has 489 branches, sub-branches and offices in Mainland China. Bank of Ningbo has grown from strength to strength since 2006, the year we first acquired a stake in what was then Ningbo Commercial Bank. We raised our stake in the renamed Bank of Ningbo in 2014. As its presence is solely in Mainland China, it complements OCBC, which has an extensive network in ASEAN and the Greater Bay Area. Together, we are well-placed to support China business customers’ expansion plans and personal customers’ wealth diversification ambitions outside Mainland China. We have increased our investment in Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populated country which offers multiple business and investment opportunities. In 2023, we announced that pending regulatory approvals, OCBC Indonesia would acquire PT Bank Commonwealth – Commonwealth Bank of Australia’s Indonesia unit which has strong wealth management and auto financing capabilities. We will hence broaden our product offerings and, as there is little customer overlap, we will welcome more than one million customers to our franchise. Wealth Management OCBC is uniquely positioned to lead in wealth management in Asia. OCBC has a regional platform to develop and distribute a wide range of products, and to provide wealth advisory services. Its three other large subsidiaries – Bank of Singapore, Great Eastern and Lion Global Investors – work seamlessly together to enhance the Group’s wealth management capabilities. Bank of Singapore has established itself as Asia’s global private bank, with booking centres in Hong Kong SAR and Singapore. It also has offices in Dubai, London, Luxembourg, Malaysia and the Philippines. Bank of Singapore has increased its offerings in alternative investments. Great Eastern, as a leading insurance company in Singapore and Malaysia, is a strategic component of OCBC Group’s wealth management proposition. Insurance is an important investment and protection class in wealth management. With bank and insurer being part of the same group, the relationship goes beyond a legal contract. Great Eastern is well-placed to customise bancassurance products, service OCBC customers and improve processes and policies, taking a long-term view. 13 12\nAsia AustraliaNorth America Insurance The inclusion of Great Eastern in OCBC is unique and adds a diversifying business pillar – Insurance – to the Group. Testament to this synergy, in June 2023, OCBC increased its stake in Great Eastern from 87.9% to 88.4%, in line with its ambition to be Asia’s leading financial services partner for a sustainable future. Great Eastern has over $100 billion in assets and over 16 million policy holders in Singapore and Malaysia, including 13 million from government schemes. It also operates in Indonesia and Brunei. In October, Great Eastern announced that, pending regulatory approvals, it would acquire AmMetLife Insurance and AmMetLife Takaful in Malaysia for an estimated RM1.121 billion. Through this opportunity, Great Eastern would be able to offer its insurance and takaful solutions to AmBank’s three million customers, providing it with an expanded distribution network in Malaysia. Insurance solutions are provided to customers through three distribution channels – aside from bancassurance which is core to OCBC’s wealth management strategy, Great Eastern’s other distribution channels are its tied agency force and financial advisory firm, Great Eastern Financial Advisors. Great Eastern’s general insurance business is underwritten by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Great Eastern General Insurance Limited (GEG), which offers customers a comprehensive suite of insurance solutions including Auto, Home, Travel, Personal Accident and Maid for retail customers and Small and Medium Business package and various Property and Casualty insurance for businesses.Asset Management Owned by OCBC and Great Eastern, Lion Global Investors is another strategic component of the OCBC Group. It is one of the largest asset management companies in Southeast Asia offering best-in-class Asian-centric investment solutions with Assets Under Management of $69.9 billion as at 31 December 2023. Tapping on its fund management expertise, Lion Global Investors has collaborated with OCBC Securities to launch several first-to-market products, bringing global securities to customers and deepening synergies within the OCBC Group. Lion-OCBC Securities Singapore Low Carbon ETF was launched in April 2022, in recognition of the growing capital allocated to aligning investment portfolios with a low carbon and climate resilient future. This was Singapore’s first ETF that focuses on the top 50 Singapore companies with lower carbon intensity. In August 2021, the Lion-OCBC Securities China Leaders ETF was launched. This was Singapore’s first China-focused ETF that pays out annual dividends to investors, allowing investors to diversify their investment portfolio through the inclusion of Chinese stocks in an easy and affordable way. Singapore’s first technology-focused ETF, the Lion-OCBC Securities Hang Seng TECH ETF, was launched in December 2020, giving investors an easy and affordable way to access Hong Kong-listed technology-themed stocks. It tracks the Hang Seng TECH Index, which is made up of the top 30 technology companies listed in Hong Kong by market capitalisation that have high business exposure to technology themes. 13 12\nThe Power of One Brand The importance of the OCBC logo cannot be overstated. An embodiment of what we stand for, any change to the logo is monumental. 2023 will therefore be remembered as a historic year for OCBC, with our last logo change occurring some time ago – a quarter of a century, to be exact. The changes we made may be subtle, but they are impactful. The clean lines and geometric circles of the iconic mark that have come to be associated with OCBC have been accentuated. A bespoke font type was created. The word ‘Bank’ was removed as OCBC is not just a bank: we offer, rather, to enable the aspirations of people and communities beyond banking. The result is a logo that is bold, strong and modern, but at its heart remains a Chinese sailing ship. This is our iconic mark that honours the migrants who crossed the seas many years ago to pursue a better life. The entrepreneurial and resilient spirit that the iconic mark represents unites all of us as One Group.We proudly unveiled the sixth iteration of the OCBC logo on 3 July 2023. Where regulations permit, all subsidiaries, branches and offices across markets have adopted the refreshed OCBC logo, a strategic move as we link up as One Group to capture the trade, wealth and investment flows between ASEAN and Greater China. Banking subsidiaries in Mainland China, Hong Kong SAR and Macau SAR also changed their legal names. 15 14\n2023 19321960s19781998 1989 15 14\nIt is also timely that we unveiled a new tagline alongside our refreshed logo which captures our brand promise. OCBC has always been about reliability and integrity. We have been helping customers succeed. We have been giving our people a career to build on. We have been giving people-in-need the help they truly need. We also ensure that we do our part to fight climate change. In all our dealings and investments, we take a long-term view. We do this because we understand that our commitment is not just to the present but also to the future, to create long-lasting impact for a better world. This is the OCBC DNA which is expressed by our new tagline. The refreshed logo and tagline were first unveiled simultaneously in Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong SAR and Macau SAR to much fanfare on 3 July 2023. Colleagues gathered at our head offices in the respective markets to witness the unveiling that was headlined by festive lion dance performances. OCBC NISP became OCBC Indonesia as it unveiled the new brand on 14 November 2023. Over 1,700 clients, partners, members of the media and staff attended the celebratory event, aptly named ‘OCBC Experience: Supporting Indonesia to the Global Stage’. The last stop was Mainland China on 6 December 2023. Over 300 OCBC China colleagues joined our Group", "bank": "OCBC", "year": "2023"}

They bring people from varied backgrounds together. Sports also help promote healthy lifestyles and mental wellbeing. OCBC Cycle and OCBC Aquatics are platforms to engage the communities beyond the financial world. Playing It Forward OCBC Cycle Singapore OCBC Cycle Singapore, a flagship sporting event, returned in full scale with more than 7,300 participants. The last time it was held physically in this scale was in 2019, before the outbreak of Covid. Participants rode on closed roads against the backdrop of Singapore’s iconic cityscape, over 40 km (The Sportive Ride) and 20 km (The Straits Times Ride). Cycling enthusiasts competed on stationary bikes in the Indoor Ride by Shimano. Many others completed the event’s longest-ever ride distance in the new 500km Virtual Ride. The OCBC Cycle Speedway Championships saw a total of 21 teams competing in either the Club or Corporate Championships. The “Teach-a-Child-to-Cycle”, the event’s corporate social responsibility programme, organised cycling lessons by professional trainers from the Singapore Cycling Federation and OCBC volunteers for children from less advantaged families under the care of Care Corner Singapore and SportCares. Sports retailer, Decathlon, sponsored the bicycles and cycling gear for these children. Cyclists could stop on the iconic Sheares Bridge to soak in the sights and take photos. Children from underprivileged backgrounds are taught how to cycle by our volunteers with bicycles donated by Decathlon. 27 26\nKuala Lumpur 2023 marked the return of the city’s only large-scale cycling event – OCBC Cycle Kuala Lumpur. After a three-year absence due to pandemic measures, the event’s return allowed about 2,500 cyclists to ride on closed roads in the city. The event took place along an uninterrupted stretch of closed roads against the city skyline with the Petronas Twin Towers in the background, with participants soaking up the beauty of Kuala Lumpur on either the 21 km or 42 km routes. Participants in Malaysia ended off the city ride in the picturesque Dataran Merdeka. Our young riders took to the streets of Macau to show off their cheery costumes. Singapore Festival 2023 was another great opportunity for us to showcase OCBC in Hong Kong and reinforce our brand with the Singaporeans living there. OCBC volunteers and Team Singapore athletes guided our beneficiaries during the event. OCBC Aquatics For the second year running, we partnered Singapore Aquatics to organise OCBC Aquatics for our employees, their families, and 50 beneficiaries from Care Corner Singapore, Ministry of Social and Family Development, and MINDS. In addition to basic swimming lessons, the event featured niche water activities, such as diving, flippa ball and artistic swimming. The participants benefited from the expertise and guidance of Team Singapore athletes, experienced facilitators from Singapore Aquatics and OCBC volunteers.Hong Kong At Hong Kong’s Singapore Festival 2023, we kickstarted our OCBC Cycle event with a Virtual Bike Challenge which saw participants face off in pairs on a virtual cycling platform. Each cyclist rides to clock the maximum distance they can manage within a minute on the stationary bikes. Participants included young beneficiaries from six non-governmental organisations, foundations and schools. Five young beneficiaries with special needs from Cherish House, a Family Service Centre, explored the fun of cycling in the safe environment.Macau The 2023 OCBC Macau Charity Family Cycle Parade was held as part of the 2023 Macau Road Cycling League. For the third consecutive year, all registration fees for the event were donated to the Caritas Macau, a charity organisation that offers assistance to underprivileged families. The introduction of a new cosplay element to the event added a fun twist to the race. Participants showed up in colourful costumes and eye-catching accessories , bringing vibrancy and liveliness to the atmosphere. 27 26\nThe OCBC", "bank": "OCBC", "year": "2023"}

Not only did we achieve a strong set of results, we also made strategic moves that will drive our growth for years to come. The theme of this annual report – “The Strengths of One Group, The Power of One Brand” – captures our focus in a nutshell. We have doubled down on our unique One Group proposition to assist our customers as we pursue growth across ASEAN and Greater China, and will continue to do so, as guided by our corporate strategy. A clear dividend policy resulting from focused capital management Capital management is integral in supporting our growth ambitions. I shared last year that this is one of my key priorities as Group Chief Financial Officer. One year on, I am glad to report that we have made good progress. We have done so by adopting a more structured approach. Taking the cue from our corporate strategy, we can better forecast, plan and allocate our capital. In doing so, we aim to strike an optimal balance between maintaining a strong capital position to support business growth and buffer for uncertainties, and increasing shareholder returns. It was our focus on capital management that enabled us to announce a clear and transparent dividend policy in February 2023. We said that we aim to pay out 50% of our earnings to shareholders. This gives a clear indication of the confidence that we have in our ability to generate high-quality earnings and long-term growth, as well as our commitment to deliver long-term shareholder value.Allocating capital to drive our ASEAN-Greater China ambitions Good capital planning and resource allocation has also enabled us to take advantage of inorganic growth opportunities. When such opportunities arise, we will always evaluate them to gauge whether it is a right fit for our franchise and culture at the right price. It was in Indonesia – one of our core markets – that we found such an opportunity. At the end of 2023, we announced that, pending regulatory approvals, our subsidiary OCBC Indonesia would be acquiring PT Bank Commonwealth, Commonwealth Bank of Australia’s Indonesia unit. This acquisition is strategic given our focus on capturing ASEAN-Greater China trade, investment and wealth flows. PT Bank Commonwealth complements OCBC Indonesia’s business with little overlap in customer base – we will potentially add more than 1 million customers to our network from this acquisition. Their strengths in wealth management and auto joint financing will broaden our franchise. To me, this acquisition is a good example where we assessed the potential returns and determined the strategic fit based on our corporate strategy, before deciding that this is where we want to park our capital. Great Eastern Holdings announced a strategic acquisition in 2023 as well – AmMetLife Insurance and AmMetLife Takaful in Malaysia – pending regulatory approvals. With this acquisition, Great Eastern Holdings would be able to offer its insurance and takaful solutions to three million AmBank customers, providing it with an expanded distribution network in Malaysia. Like the PT Bank Commonwealth acquisition, the synergies are apparent. As other opportunities come along in future, Chin Yee Group Chief Financial Officer 33 32\nwe will evaluate them using similar strategic lens. Tapping innovative, diversified sources of funding Another important part of capital management is finding innovative, diversified funding sources to support growth. In addition to our strong deposit base which currently forms a large proportion of our funding sources, we also tap on wholesale funding markets across currencies and capital instruments. There are two such issuances in 2023 that I would like to cite. In May, OCBC Sydney Branch priced A$1 billion of three-year senior floating rate green notes, the largest single-tranche deal by a Singaporean issuer in Australia. This issuance was primarily used to fund our Sydney Branch locally to support lending to a wide range of corporations – many of whom are our network corporate customers. This is our third green bond issuance, in line with our Group’s commitment on", "bank": "OCBC", "year": "2023"}

In recent years, we do see a growing portfolio of Australian green projects that we can support to drive the country’s transition to a low-carbon economy. Following this, in August, we priced a $550 million 4.50 percent perpetual capital securities first callable in 2029. This was the first Singapore Dollar Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bond since the write-down of certain AT1 bonds following the banking turmoil earlier in 2023. While there was apprehension around AT1 bonds following the write-down, the negative sentiment had calmed by then. The issuance attracted robust interest from investors as they searched for high-quality names to invest in. We believe our strong capital and liquidity positions, and high credit rating throughout the banking turmoil were important considerations and these gave investors the confidence to participate in our bonds. Notably, we achieved the tightest spread on record in the Singapore Dollar Bond Market for the AT1 issued. We will continue to calibrate our issuances to sustain a strong foothold and brand name in the bond market. Solidifying our strengths and transforming for the future What is next for Group Finance?

{"section_title": "CEO Helen mentioned in her message, proactive management of our balance sheet has b", "content": "CEO Helen mentioned in her message, proactive management of our balance sheet has been crucial. It helped us make the most out of a rising interest rate environment. This was reflected in our record-high net interest income and significant net interest margin expansion in 2023. As interest rates come down, we must be similarly agile to seize a different set of opportunities. Can we build up our loan volume and capitalise on the revival of business and trade activities? How do we manage our funding sources and costs? Would we be able to capture the rising wealth, investment and insurance flows when market conditions improve? Therein lies the sound fundamentals of OCBC Group’s business structure. Our comprehensive banking, wealth management, insurance and asset management franchise makes us unique. When the business landscape is not conducive for a certain business pillar, we rely on the others for growth, and this is how we protect our earnings during different phases of the interest rate and business cycles. When we talk about the future, digitalisation naturally comes into play. Group Finance is taking a three-pronged approach in our digitalisation journey. First, we continue to keep up with and invest in technology to refresh core applications to enable straight-through processing, richer analysis, timely reporting as well as nimble forecasting and planning. Second, we progressively deploy robotics process automation (RPA) to streamline finance processes and drive operational efficiencies. We already have quite a few RPAs in operation. The savings in man hours and derived efficiencies are substantial. Finally, we need to focus on strengthening our business analytics and machine learning capabilities to proactively provide insights and foresights to businesses and management for timely and effective decision making. This would require us to invest resources into leveraging new technologies and extracting more value from data. We have already made much progress on the data analytics front, and going forward we will invest in harnessing the transformative capabilities of generative AI. I am looking forward with excitement to what the future has in store and the opportunities that await. But at this juncture, I would like to take a pause to thank all my colleagues in Group Finance and across OCBC, for the commitment, good work and strong collaboration in 2023. To the wider investment community as well – thank you for your support. We deeply value the active engagements that we had with you in 2023 which gave us ample opportunities to update you on OCBC’s developments. We look forward to working even more closely with you in future. 33 32\nKhiang Tong Group Chief Operating Officer In my view, an organisation’s employee experience is connected to how it delivers its customer experience. The advancement of technology has further strengthened this connection. Hence, we doubled down on our efforts in these three areas – employee experience, customer experience and technology – last year. One of the tools that we invested in to elevate employee experience was the roll-out of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot to our employees globally in November 2023. This was a first by a Singapore bank. The chatbot, OCBC GPT, can be used to help with writing, research and ideation. The feedback from our people has been positive. They have reported productivity boosts of about 50%.On the customer front, we worked closely with our consumer banking team to launch a fully digital account opening process for consumers in our core markets who are relocating to Singapore. Individuals in Hong Kong SAR, Indonesia, Malaysia and Mainland China who plan to relocate to Singapore can now open Singapore dollar and multi-currency accounts remotely on the OCBC Digital app, within minutes. This expedites the entire relocation process for them since a bank account facilitates two other key administrative arrangements – salary crediting and securing of accommodation. 2023 also marked the commencement of Phase 2 of our seven-year digital core roadmap which began in 2019. Over $300 million will be invested between 2023 and 2025 to continue the modernisation of our technology architecture. This further builds on the $250 million invested in Phase 1 (2019 to 2022). The earlier investment to refresh our key channel systems across our markets enabled the quicker roll-out of digital features and sharpened our personalisation capabilities via machine learning and AI. Tapping on emerging technologies Generative AI has been a game-changer in the emerging technologies space and we see it as a long-term investment. Our intent is to embed it in our processes and systems. Other than OCBC GPT, we deployed several generative AI productivity tools in 2023. One of them is OCBC Wingman – a coding assistant built internally – which helps our developers to auto generate, debug and improve computer codes. Leveraging open source software, we were able to build and deploy OCBC Wingman in just two weeks. Since its launch in May 2023, productivity boosts of about 20% have been reported. As a result, the bank has also been able to deploy new features with significant speed, and improve time-to-market for new digital solutions. Ultimately, the productivity gains arising from the deployment of these generative AI tools free up employees’ time and enable them to deliver better services for our customers. Apart from generative AI, we continue to focus on predictive AI. Around 4 million decisions are made in the Bank with the help of AI every day. These decisions help in managing", "bank": "OCBC", "year": "2023"}

This figure is expected to more than double, to 10 million, within the next two years. We will continue to invest and tap on this technology for the benefit of our customers and employees. 35 34\nExploring fast-moving, emerging technologies like the metaverse, blockchain and digital assets are on our agenda as well. In April 2023, OCBCx65Chulia – our metaverse platform in Decentraland – was launched. Named after the address of the Bank’s Singapore headquarters on Chulia Street, the virtual reality platform allows visitors to learn about OCBC’s historical milestones along with the latest banking products and services. They can open a bank account and apply for a credit card through instant access to the Bank’s website from OCBCx65Chulia. It is important that we embrace an experimental mindset in today’s fast evolving technology landscape. Often, the real potential of emerging platforms and technologies such as the metaverse are not obvious in the early stages. However, testing them at this juncture allows us to better understand these technologies and develop the relevant skills to ensure that we are ahead of our peers in reaping the dividends when these technologies do take off. We also supported innovative pilots with the authorities to expand and develop capabilities in asset tokenisation initiatives that leverage blockchain. These pilots include the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and Purpose Bound Money (PBM). CBDCs enable instantaneous interbank settlement while PBM allows issuers to set specific conditions on how it is used. These digital money trials open up new possibilities and we are watching this space closely. Investing in people and the environment Investing in technology is but one piece of the puzzle to be future-ready. The way we approach and implement these investments, and bring our employees along the journey, are equally important. We have streamlined more than 1,500 processes to enhance operational efficiency over the past year. An example is what we termed the “Unified Experience”, which connects the front, middle and support functions by eliminating emails and excessive workflows. Disparate processes slow down teams. By enabling teams to work more seamlessly, we can enhance responsiveness to our customers. Another aspect to our operations that we have been focused on is in lowering our carbon footprint. While we have achieved carbon neutrality from 2022, we remain committed to advancing operational decarbonisation. This involves prioritising the deployment of sustainable technologies to optimise the energy efficiency of our buildings. Solar panels have been installed in our offices across the region – in Mainland China, Singapore and Indonesia – and we have increased the use of renewable energy sources where feasible. A total of 27,000 square feet of solar panels have been deployed, leading to significant electricity savings. While we are guided by the drive to accelerate our own decarbonisation efforts, there is a limit to what we can achieve alone. Hence, we seek out partnerships with industry players to uplift the ecosystem and deliver more long-term outcomes. It is with this in mind that we jointly launched the SGBC-OCBC Built Environment Decarbonisation Challenge with the Singapore Green Building Council to identify and support innovative technology solutions to decarbonise the built environment. More than 70 companies submitted proposals showcasing solutions that prioritise carbon abatement and energy efficiency in buildings while considering cost-effectiveness and practicality in terms of deployment and maintenance. Shortlisted solutions will be piloted at selected OCBC buildings, with the possibility of implementing them at all OCBC buildings if feasible. Looking ahead to 2024, we are committed to advancing our investments in technology, our people and the environment. Improving the employee and customer experience will remain a key priority and we will maintain a forward-thinking approach to stay at the forefront of technological advancements. This will enable us to deliver exceptional financial services and products to our customers, so they can pursue and realise their aspirations. Our metaverse, OCBCx65Chulia, was launched as an interactive virtual platform for our younger audience. 35 34\nNoel Group Chief", "bank": "OCBC", "year": "2023"}

With the expanded network that includes Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, we were able to better support Greater China corporates investing in ASEAN. We continued our digitalisation efforts to acquire and deepen our relationships with customers as well as to improve customer experience. In Malaysia, we rolled out a digital Shariah-compliant business account – OCBC eBiz Account-i – that can be opened entirely online. This builds on the highly successful and fully online OCBC eBiz Account that was launched in July 2021, which has consistently garnered over 10,000 sign-ups each calendar year. We launched new QR collections options on our OneCollect platform, which lets merchants collect payments through a QR code. Monthly transactions on OneCollect grew 2.5 times from January 2023 to December 2023. The number of merchants registered grew by about 30 per cent in the same period. We continued to enhance our Velocity and Mobile Banking platforms with new capabilities. Nearly 70 per cent of our trade finance customers in Singapore have done away with traditional paper applications and now apply online for trade solutions such as import letters of credit, banker’s guarantees and trade loans. We also launched 35 new currencies for international payments, bringing the total to over 60 currencies. In recognition of our efforts, we were awarded the Best Transaction Bank in Singapore, as well as the Best Corporate Mobile Initiative – “OCBC Business App” at The Asian Banker Transaction Finance Awards. 39 38\nTowards a Net Zero ASEAN and Greater China Our sustainable finance loan commitments surpassed $50 billion in 2023, well ahead of our targeted timeline of 2025. Particularly for SMEs across the region, we saw promising traction in their energy transition plans. Their take-up of sustainable financing doubled year-on-year to reach over $7 billion, with the number of borrowers doubling to more than 1,200. In May 2023, we unveiled science- based decarbonisation targets for six high-emissions intensive sectors – Power, Oil and Gas, Real Estate, Steel, Aviation and Shipping – and the key actions that the Bank will take to meet these targets as part of our commitment to achieve Net Zero in our financed emissions by 2050. In addition, we committed not to extend project financing to upstream Oil and Gas projects that obtained approval for development after 2021. This is on top of the target (a 35% reduction in absolute emissions by 2030 for the Oil and Gas sector) that the Bank had set. To drive this transition journey, we have developed sustainable financing solutions for our corporate clients to finance their green and transition business activities. The OCBC 1.5°C loan is one such example. A first-to-market sustainable financing solution, the loan incentivises corporates to set, and work towards, clear emissions reduction targets aligned with internationally recognised, science-based decarbonisation pathways for their sectors.

We continue to see fresh funds from our core markets. In particular, the number of family office clients grew about 30% last year, reinforcing our position as a leading player in this space. We have also seen meaningful growth in the penetration rate of our clients within alternative investing, having invested in our alternative capital platform over the last few years.

Singapore’s growing stature as a global wealth management hub and Asia’s rising prosperity, position us well to achieve our goal.

We have observed that individuals are looking at different markets for diversification opportunities, leading to more wealth flows in the region. These are what we want to capture. But how will we go about achieving this? First, we must accelerate acquisition across the region. Second, we must deepen our engagement with customers. Digital plays a key role in both areas. Accelerating acquisition around the region Let me first talk about acquisition and our progress on this front. We doubled down on our efforts to grow our customer base across the region and I am pleased to share that new-to-bank customers across all our core markets grew 26% year-on-year. A key initiative that drove acquisition was the launch of a fully digital account opening process for customers across the region. Consumers in Hong Kong SAR, Indonesia, Malaysia and Mainland China who plan to relocate to Singapore can open an OCBC Singapore account remotely using our OCBC Digital app – and it would take them just minutes. I am very proud of the team for pushing this through and enabling us to be the first Singapore bank to have this capability. Acquisition for our Premier Banking segment was also strong. Here, our twin wealth hubs of Singapore and Hong Kong SAR are especially attractive. Hong Kong SAR was a market where we made a concerted effort last year.

This speaks to how our digital wealth management services are increasingly sought after, and why we will continue to invest in strengthening our capabilities. We also want to introduce more innovative digital products and services that address customers’ lifestyle needs. For instance, as travel continued to pick up, we strengthened our OCBC Digital app’s cross-border QR payment capabilities. Notably, there was a seven-times increase in cross-border QR payments since we launched Alipay+ on OCBC Digital in September 2023.

We are proud to say that financial transactions performed digitally across our core markets are growing. In Singapore, 97% of financial transactions are now performed digitally, while the figures are 96% in Malaysia and 95% in Indonesia. Still, we cannot forget that some of our customers are not as digitally savvy. That is why we are not a digital-only bank. Branches remain key and we have leveraged them for the very well-received OCBC Digital Silvers workshops in Singapore. ‘Heart’ is also the reason why we moved quickly to protect our customers from malware and phishing scams. In August 2023, we were the first bank in Singapore to introduce an anti-malware security feature on our OCBC Digital app. The introduction of this measure required striking a balance between security and convenience.

New technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain, are increasingly disrupting the workplace and current job roles. In the face of such transformations, we remain even more resolute in continuing to provide growth and job mobility opportunities for our colleagues throughout their career with us. Beyond technology disruption and its impact on jobs and skills, we also worked to address issues that our colleagues may face during these challenging times. For example, in recognition of rising cost-of-living concerns, we rolled out a one-off support to more than 14,000 junior colleagues. The support totalled close to $9 million and covered colleagues across OCBC and our subsidiaries globally.Our commitment to our people is demonstrated by the recognition we have received, which includes the ‘IBF Inspire Award’ from The Institute of Banking and Finance Singapore (IBF), the ‘Wellbeing Innovation Award’ from Workwell Leaders and the ‘Best Employer Award in Greater China’ from HRoot. Our vision remains unchanged; we want OCBC to be a place where the best want to work, and where our people enjoy coming to every day, for now and beyond. Investing in our people Building on our previous investment of $50 million, we are committing another $30 million towards employee development and mobility over the next three years from 2023 to 2025. This, to me, is the most fundamental way we can motivate and engage our people, helping them grow with us. It also helps us build a more resilient workforce where there is a breadth of skills and not just technical domain expertise. Training and certifying senior leaders as career coaches is one of the new programmes that we have introduced. The internal coaching certification programme, which is in line with the Internal Coaching Federation’s framework, has seen more than 20 senior leaders certified since its launch in October 2023. All colleagues – regardless of their ranks – will be able to tap on the guidance from these coaches. This approach distinguishes our programme from others (typically, career coaches are available only to senior employees). Response to the programme, from both senior leaders and other colleagues, has been overwhelming. An artificial intelligence (AI)-driven career marketplace is another initiative that will be made available to all colleagues globally in the second quarter of 2024. In line with the Singapore government’s push towards a skills-first approach, which is also intrinsically ours, the platform goes beyond being a regular job portal. Personalised recommendations for roles within the Group will be delivered to colleagues. The suggestions will be derived by reviewing a colleague’s skill set based on their existing role, the courses they have completed, and the competencies required for various job openings. In the future, colleagues will be able to apply for short-term stints within the bank (outside of their regular roles). These gig assignments provide yet another avenue to add to the skills portfolio of our colleagues. Developing the leader in everyone One of our learning design principles is anchored on leadership. This is all about positive modelling, guidance and sharing by leaders of all definitions. Leadership programmes at OCBC are not limited solely to senior colleagues. Instead, we offer a comprehensive suite of programmes covering self-leadership, peer leadership and organisational leadership across different ranks, 47 46\nincluding entry-level colleagues across the Bank. Over the last five years, we have grown the number of leadership programmes by more than five times. These programmes include the OCBC Nanyang Technological University Executive Development Programme, LEAD (a three-month programme to build key competencies from adaptability and strategic thinking, to leading courageously), OCBC INSEAD Executive Development Programme and BOLD (a group-wide senior leadership programme which provides experienced leaders with insights and perspectives on global issues affecting organisations and countries). Through these, we equip our people for leadership success by honing their agility and ability to effectively navigate uncertain and complex situations, both individually and as leaders. Our leadership programmes also emphasise meaning and purpose, empowering our colleagues to pursue passion projects. Guided by OCBC’s Purpose – to enable people and communities to realise their aspirations – a team of colleagues across various divisions under our LEAD programme realised an 18-month-long project in December 2023. It was a project that contributed meaningfully to those in need, specifically those without access to digital devices. The team was spurred on by this thought: In a digital age where much learning happens online, no one should be left behind. Not having a computer could hamper an underprivileged person’s learning opportunities, employment chances and social participation in the long run. Through Care Corner Singapore, the team was able to distribute 120 serviceable ‘retired’ laptops to underprivileged families. We are deeply encouraged by the commitment displayed by the team through the long hours they spent outside of work on their project, which ran far beyond the three-month LEAD programme. This demonstrates the significant impact leadership can have. It serves as an inspiration for more colleagues to follow in the future. Building workplace diversity In 2023, we doubled down on our hiring efforts to provide opportunities for individuals who may have been overlooked in traditional hiring practices.We partnered three non-profit organisations – SG Enable, Autism Resource Centre and SPD – to avail employment opportunities for persons with disabilities. These individuals took on roles within our Human Resources Marketing, Digital Transformation and Operations & Technology teams. I am pleased to share that through working with them, colleagues have found that our work culture has been enriched. We hope to build on this momentum by exploring the possibility of having a contact centre staffed by persons with disabilities eventually. To assist with the integration of these new colleagues, job coaches and mentors are matched to them to provide on-the-job support and guidance. In collaboration with our partners, we also conducted disability awareness trainings and provided disability etiquette resources to foster understanding and sensitivity among colleagues, creating a supportive environment. Another group in the community that we have focused on integrating into our workforce are individuals who wish to return to work – these include mums, caregivers and retirees. Under a new programme that targets such individuals, they can take up permanent half-day work arrangements, work full- or part-time based on hours of their choice or opt for project-based gig work. At present, they have taken up roles at various bank branches, and in our Legal & Compliance and Operations teams. We will continue to explore more opportunities to bring diversity to our OCBC workforce. With the foundation that we have put in place, we are making good progress towards realising our vision of making OCBC a place where the best want to work, and where our people enjoy coming to every day.

Share Schemes • OCBC Sh are Option Scheme 2001 The Bank has ceased granting share options under the OCBC Share Option Scheme 2001 (2001 Scheme) effective from financial year 2018 remuneration. The 2001 Scheme which was extended from 2011 had ceased operation on 2 August 2021. Share options granted in prior years continue to be outstanding until the options lapse or are exercised by the recipients. The validity period of the options granted is subject to legislation applicable on the date of grant. Options granted to Group executives are exercisable for up to 10 years, while options granted to non-executive Directors are exercisable for up to five years. The options granted will lapse immediately upon termination of employment or appointment, except in certain events such as ill health, injury or disability, retirement at or after the applicable retirement age, redundancy, or other events approved by the Remuneration Committee, in which case the Remuneration Committee may allow all or any part of such options to be preserved such that they can be exercisable within the relevant exercise periods or such periods as may be determined by the Remuneration Committee. Shares granted upon the exercising of options are allocated from treasury shares or from new ordinary shares issued by the Bank. The 2001 Scheme also contains provisions which allow for the cancellation and clawback of grants if it is determined, amongst other things, that they were made on the basis of materially inaccurate financial statements and/or that the grantee had engaged in conduct that resulted in financial loss, reputational harm, restatement of financial results or financial statements, adverse changes to the Bank’s and/or the Group’s", "bank": "OCBC", "year": "2023"}

It also aligns the interests of executives with the sustained business performance of the Bank. Group executives holding the rank or equivalent rank of Assistant Manager and above, and any Group Executive Director selected by the Remuneration Committee, are eligible to participate in the Plan. In 2021, the Bank adopted a new OCBC Deferred Share Plan 2021 (DSP 2021). The new OCBC DSP 2021 permits new ordinary shares to be issued to satisfy the Bank’s delivery obligations under the Plan. It replaces the previous OCBC Deferred Share Plan, under which no new ordinary shares may be issued. The participants are executives of the Bank, selected overseas locations and subsidiaries. Under the DSP 2021, share awards are granted annually to eligible executives who are paid variable performance bonuses exceeding $100,000 for the previous year. The share awards form 20% to 40% of their total variable performance bonus for the relevant year. Half (50%) of the share awards will vest after two years with the remaining 50% vesting at the end of three years in accordance with the guidelines established under the DSP 2021. The grants are part of the variable performance bonuses already earned for the prior year where the delivery of key performance indicator targets have already been completed. There are no further performance conditions imposed prior to the vesting of the share awards, other than those described below and on pages 57 and 58 of the 2023 Annual Report relating to the conditions for cancellation and clawback of these share awards. Prior to the vesting date, the executives will not be accorded voting rights for the shares. By implementing the DSP 2021, which permits new ordinary shares to be issued, the Bank has greater flexibility in its methods for delivery of ordinary shares to fulfil share grants, as this can be effected through an issue of new ordinary shares, in addition to the transfer of existing ordinary shares (including treasury shares). The unvested deferred share grants will be adjusted to take into account dividends declared by the Bank. The additional shares granted in respect of this adjustment may be acquired from the market in accordance with guidelines established under the Plan. The share awards granted will lapse immediately upon termination of employment or appointment, except in certain events such as ill health, injury or disability, retirement at or after the applicable retirement age, redundancy, or other events approved by the Remuneration Committee, in which case the Remuneration Committee may allow all or any part of such awards to be preserved such that they can be vested within the relevant vesting periods or such periods as may be determined by the Remuneration Committee. The DSP 2021 also contains provisions which allow for the cancellation and clawback of grants if it is determined, amongst other things, that they were granted on the basis of materially inaccurate financial statements and/or that the grantee had engaged in conduct that resulted in financial loss, reputational harm, restatement of financial results or financial statements, adverse changes to the Bank’s and/or the Group’s", "bank": "OCBC", "year": "2023"}

The ESPP is a saving-based share ownership plan to help employees own ordinary shares in the Bank through their monthly contributions via deductions from payroll (CPF has been removed as a contribution mode for offering periods commencing on or after 1 January 2024). The employees have the option to convert the contributions to ordinary shares after one year or to withdraw the contributions at any time. As a further incentive to employees to enrol in the ESPP, the Bank pays interest on the amounts saved at a preferential interest rate. The duration of the offering period is 24 months and the share acquisition price is fixed before the offering period based on the average of the last traded prices over the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the price fixing date. Shares granted upon conversions in accordance with the rules of the ESPP are allocated from treasury shares or from new ordinary shares issued by the Bank. The aggregate number of new ordinary shares issued by the Bank pursuant to the ESPP, together with the aggregate number of any new ordinary shares issued pursuant to the 2001 Scheme and the aggregate number of new ordinary shares issued to awards granted under the DSP 2021, cannot exceed 10% of the Bank’s total number of issued ordinary shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings (as defined in the SGX-ST Listing Manual)).

The Audit Committee members keep abreast of changes to accounting standards and development of related significant accounting policies which have a direct impact on financial statements and Group accounting policies through briefings provided by internal or external subject matter experts. The Audit Committee also reviews significant financial reporting issues and judgements to ensure the integrity of the financial statements.

The whistleblowing policy and procedures for raising such concerns are disclosed and clearly communicated to employees.

As part of its assurance process on the objectivity and independence of the external auditor, the Audit Committee has in place a policy that lists the non-audit services which may not be provided by the external auditor and sets out the circumstances in which the external auditor may be permitted to undertake non-audit services. Permitted non-audit services with a fee exceeding $250,000 per engagement require the approval of the Audit Committee before the auditor can be engaged.

TMBAM’s inability to sell illiquid securities forced these four funds, with a total value of about US$4 billion, to be suspended and subsequently closed due to the non-existence of gating and swing pricing mechanisms in the Thai market at that time. Post the suspension and as the markets recovered, TMBAM was able to sell the illiquid securities and returned all the funds to investors within 18 months at prices above those at the time of the suspension. Nonetheless, given the closures, the Securities and Exchange Commission in Thailand (SECT) conducted an on-site inspection of the four closed funds and issued the final inspection report on 20 October 2021. SECT did not find any wilful intention on the part of TMBAM, or any of its directors not to comply with relevant requirements.

All British pound, Euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen LIBORs, as well as the 1-week and 2-month US dollar LIBOR were discontinued on 31 December 2021. All remaining US dollar LIBORs were discontinued on 30 June 2023. The discontinuation of LIBOR had a direct impact on the viability of the Singapore Dollar Swap Offer Rate (SOR), which relied on US dollar LIBOR in its computation. Additionally, like LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR), a key benchmark widely used in retail loans, is subject to expert judgement due to a lack of underlying transactions. The Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA) was identified as the alternative benchmark to SOR and SIBOR. MAS established an industry-led Steering Committee for SOR & SIBOR Transition to SORA (SC-STS) to oversee the coordination and implementation of the transition efforts. To ensure a smooth transition from LIBOR to RFRs and SOR and SIBOR to SORA, we also established an internal Steering Committee to coordinate efforts across various business, control and support functions. We make the necessary system upgrades and modifications to ensure the readiness of our infrastructure and processes in a timely manner. We have also assessed the adequacy of provisions relating to the discontinuation of benchmarks in our documentation for loans, derivatives, debt instruments and other relevant transactions, and remediated the necessary documentation. With the cessation of US dollar LIBOR and SOR on 30 June 2023, all retail and corporate loans and derivatives referencing SOR have successfully transitioned to SORA, fixed rates or other industry standard replacement rates. Appropriate adjustments were made as recommended by the industry to reflect the differences between SOR and SORA. As of 31 December 2023, loans and derivatives referencing US dollar LIBOR have also successfully transitioned to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), fixed rates or other industry standard replacement rates as agreed between contracting parties. There was no significant impact from the cessation of US dollar LIBOR and SOR. For SIBOR, the transition will be completed in 2024 in line with the roadmap established by the industry. No significant impact is expected from the transition of SIBOR to SORA.

{"section_title": "Management Discussion and Analysis", "content": "Management Discussion and Analysis\nOverview (continued) Group net profit was $7.02 billion for the financial year 2023, up 27% from $5.53 billion a year ago. Total income for 2023 rose to a new high of $13.5 billion, lifted by growth across the Group’s diversified income streams, with net interest income at a record high, and trading and investment income higher. Loan-related and credit card fees rose, but overall fee income was down as subdued investment sentiments continued to weigh on wealth-related fees. Continued cost discipline amid an inflationary environment, combined with income growth, drove the cost-to-income ratio lower to 38.7%. Asset quality was resilient with NPL ratio of 1.0% and credit costs at 20 basis points. The Group’s strong capital, funding and liquidity levels provide ample headroom to drive growth and capture opportunities as they arise. With strong earnings and sound capital position, the final dividend was raised to 42 cents per share from 40 cents a year ago. This brings the 2023 dividend to 82 cents per share, up 21% from 68 cents a year ago and represents a payout ratio of 53% of the Group’s 2023 net profit. Record net interest income of $9.65 billion was 25% higher than a year ago, underpinned by a 5% growth in average assets and a 37-basis point expansion in net interest margin (NIM) to 2.28%. NIM was higher across all key markets, benefitting from the higher interest rate environment and proactive balance sheet management. Non-interest income rose 7% to $3.86 billion. The increase was largely attributed to improved trading income and investment gains. Net fee income of $1.80 billion was 3% below the $1.85 billion in the previous year. Higher fees from credit card and loan-related activities were more than offset by lower wealth-related fees as customer activities remained subdued amid global", "bank": "OCBC", "year": "2023"}

Net trading income improved 8% to $1.00 billion, from $929 million a year ago, driven by record customer flow treasury income. Net realised gains from sale of investment securities were $47 million, as compared to a net loss of $206 million in 2022 that was largely attributed to rebalancing of the fixed income portfolio. Insurance income was $808 million as compared to $803 million a year ago. Great Eastern Holdings (GEH) adopted Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I)) 17 on 1 January 2023, and the Group’s insurance results for 2023 are prepared based on SFRS(I) 17 and respective comparatives for 2022 have been restated. Total weighted new sales and new business embedded value (NBEV) were $1.66 billion and $762 million respectively, while NBEV margin was higher at 45.9%. GEH’s embedded value, a measure of the long-term economic value of the existing business of a life insurance company, was $17.3 billion as at 31 December 2023. The Group’s wealth management income, comprising income from insurance, private banking, premier private client, premier banking, asset management and stockbroking comprised 32% of the Group’s total income. Wealth management income for 2023 rose 26% to $4.32 billion, up from $3.42 billion a year ago. Group wealth management AUM expanded 2% to $263 billion, from $258 billion in the previous year. Operating expenses increased 8% to $5.22 billion. This was largely attributed to higher staff costs, IT-related costs and other operational expenses associated with business growth. The rise in staff costs was led by annual salary adjustments, headcount growth and a one-off support to help junior employees cope with rising cost-of-living concerns.

Global Consumer/Private Banking Global Consumer/Private Banking provides a full range of products and services to individual customers. At Global Consumer Banking, the products and services offered include deposit products (checking accounts, savings and fixed deposits), consumer loans (housing loans and other personal loans), credit cards, wealth management products (unit trusts, bancassurance products and structured deposits) and brokerage services. Private Banking caters to the specialised banking needs of high net worth individuals, offering wealth management expertise, including investment advice and portfolio management services, estate and trust planning, and wealth structuring. Global Consumer/Private Banking’s 2023 profit before income tax rose 65% to $2.23 billion, driven by net interest income growth from rise in interest rates, partly offset by higher expenses and allowances. Global Wholesale Banking Global Wholesale Banking serves institutional customers ranging from large corporates and the public sector to small and medium enterprises. The business provides a full range of financing solutions including long-term project financing, short-term credit, working capital and trade financing, as well as customised and structured equity-linked financing. It also provides customers with a broad range of products and services such as cash management and custodian services, capital market solutions, corporate finance services and advisory banking, and treasury products. Global Wholesale Banking’s profit before income tax grew 37% to $3.88 billion in 2023 from $2.84 billion a year ago. The higher profit was led by net interest income growth and higher income from investment banking activities, partly offset by an increase in expenses and allowances.\nPerformance by Business Segment (continued) Global Markets Global Markets is responsible for the management of the Group’s asset and liability interest rate positions, engages in foreign exchange activities, money market operations, fixed income and derivatives trading, and offers structured treasury products and financial solutions to meet customers’ investment and hedging needs. Income from treasury products and services offered to customers in Global Consumer/Private Banking and Global Wholesale Banking, is reflected in the respective business segments. Global Markets’ profit before income tax was down 94% to $39 million in 2023 from high funding cost and drop in net trading income, partly offset by higher realised gains from its fixed income portfolio. Insurance The Group’s insurance business, including its fund management activities, is undertaken by 88.4%-owned subsidiary GEH and its subsidiaries, which provide both life and general insurance products to its customers mainly in Singapore and Malaysia. GEH’s profit before income tax was $891 million in 2023, 31% higher from $681 million in 2022, mainly attributable to improved investment performance in its Shareholders’ fund. After tax and non-controlling interests, GEH’s contribution to the Group’s net profit was $636 million in 2023, higher than the $489 million in 2022. Others Others comprise mainly property holding, investment holding and items not attributable to the business segments described above.

The ESP Plan was extended for a further period of 10 years from 19 May 2024 up to 18 May 2034 (both dates inclusive), with the approval of shareholders at the annual general meeting of the Bank which was held on 25 April 2023. Employees of the Group who have attained the age of 21 years and have been employed for not less than six months are eligible to participate in the ESP Plan. At an extraordinary general meeting held on 17 April 2009, alterations to the ESP Plan were approved to enable two (but not more than two) Offering Periods to be outstanding on any date. Since each Offering Period currently consists of a 24-month period, these alterations will enable the Bank to prescribe Offering Periods once every 12 months (instead of once every 24 months as was previously the case). In July 2023, the Bank launched its eighteenth offering under the ESP Plan, which commenced on 1 September 2023 and will expire on 31 August 2025. Under the eighteenth offering, 7,062 employees enrolled to participate in the ESP Plan to acquire 8,899,030 ordinary shares at S$12.47 per ordinary share. The acquisition price is equal to the average of the last traded price of the ordinary shares of the Bank on the Singapore Exchange over five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the price fixing date. Particulars of the first to seventeenth offerings under the ESP Plan were set out in the Directors’ Reports/Directors’ Statements for the financial years ended 31 December 2004 to 2022. During the financial year, 6,589,209 ordinary shares were delivered to participants under the ESP Plan. As at the end of the financial year, there were (i) rights to acquire 7,078,986 ordinary shares at S$12.07 per ordinary share granted under the seventeenth offering (which will expire on 31 August 2024) outstanding, and (ii) rights to acquire 8,413,463 ordinary shares at S$12.47 per ordinary share granted under the eighteenth offering (which will expire on 31 August 2025) outstanding. Further details on the ESP Plan can be found in Note 13.3 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. (c) OCBC Deferred Share Plan The Bank implemented the OCBC Deferred Share Plan (DSP) in 2003. The DSP was a discretionary incentive and retention award programme extended to executives of the Group at the absolute discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The DSP was terminated with effect from 29 April 2021, following the adoption of the OCBC Deferred Share Plan 2021 at the annual general meeting of the Bank held on 29 April 2021. However, the termination of the DSP does not affect the awards which have been granted, whether such awards have been released (whether fully or partially) or not. In light of the Bank’s transition to the new OCBC DSP 2021, no awards were granted under the DSP during the financial year ended 31 December 2023. Existing awards were adjusted following the declarations of a final dividend for the financial year ended 31 December 2022, and an interim dividend for the financial year ended 31 December 2023, resulting in an additional 675 ordinary shares being subject to awards under the DSP. During the financial year, 5,413,124 deferred shares were released to grantees, of which 102,324 deferred shares were released to Ms Helen Wong Pik Kuen, who was appointed as a director of the Bank on 7 February 2023.\nShare-Based Compensation Plans (continued) (d) OCBC Deferred Share Plan 2021 The OCBC Deferred Share Plan 2021 (DSP 2021) was adopted at the annual general meeting of the Bank held on 29 April 2021 to replace the DSP under which no new ordinary shares may be issued. By implementing the DSP 2021, which permits new ordinary shares to be issued, the Bank has greater flexibility in its methods for delivery of ordinary shares, as this can be effected through an issue of new ordinary shares, in addition to the transfer of existing ordinary shares (including treasury shares). The objectives of the DSP 2021 are otherwise the same as those for the DSP, which are to align the interests of Group executives with the sustained business performance of the Bank by way of awards of deferred shares as part of variable performance already earned for the previous year. Awards over an aggregate of 6,785,111 ordinary shares (including awards over 287,200 ordinary shares granted to Ms Helen Wong Pik Kuen who was appointed as a director of the Bank on 7 February 2023) were granted to eligible executives under the DSP 2021 during the financial year ended 31 December 2023, and awards over an aggregate of 23,781,132 ordinary shares (including awards over 599,499 ordinary shares granted to Ms Helen Wong Pik Kuen) have been granted under the DSP 2021 since the commencement of the plan to the end of the financial year ended 31 December 2023. An aggregate of 19,451,075 ordinary shares (including 578,330 ordinary shares comprised in awards granted to Ms Helen Wong Pik Kuen) are comprised in awards which are outstanding and have not been released under the DSP 2021 as at the end of the financial year ended 31 December 2023. Existing awards were adjusted following the declarations of a final dividend for the financial year ended 31 December 2022, and an interim dividend for the financial year ended 31 December 2023, resulting in an additional 1,256,219 ordinary shares being subject to awards under the DSP 2021 (including an additional 35,594 ordinary shares being subject to awards held by Ms Helen Wong Pik Kuen). During the financial year, 3,787,000 deferred shares were released to grantees, of which 76,853 deferred shares were released to Ms Helen Wong Pik Kuen. The deferred shares which were released during the financial year were delivered by way of the transfer of existing ordinary shares to the relevant grantees. Details of options granted under the 2001 Scheme and share awards granted under the DSP and DSP 2021 to directors of the Bank are as follows: NameOptions/ awards granted during the financial year ended 31.12.2023Aggregate number of options/ awards granted since commencement of scheme/plan to 31.12.2023Aggregate number of options exercised/awards released since commencement of scheme/plan to 31.12.2023 Aggregate number of options/ awards outstanding at 31.12.2023 (1) 2001 Scheme Andrew Lee Kok Keng – 724,065 680,553 43,512 DSPHelen Wong Pik Kuen – 179,789(2)199,995(3)– DSP 2021Helen Wong Pik Kuen 287,200(2)599,499(2)76,853(3)578,330 (1) These details have already been disclosed in the section on “Directors’ interests in shares or debentures” above.

(3)The deferred shares which were released were delivered by way of the transfer of existing ordinary shares to Ms Helen Wong Pik Kuen. There were no changes to the above-mentioned interests between the end of the financial year and 21 January 2024. Except as disclosed above, no options under the 2001 Scheme, no acquisition rights under the ESP Plan and no share awards under the DSP 2021 were granted to any of the directors of the Bank who held office during the financial year ended 31 December 2023. Except as disclosed above, there were no unissued shares of the Bank or its subsidiaries under options granted by the Bank or its subsidiaries as at the end of the financial year.\nAudit Committee The members of the Audit Committee as at the date of this statement are: Chua Kim Chiu,", "bank": "OCBC", "year": "2023"}

These allowances are determined by the Group based on the Expected Credit Losses (“ECL”) framework under SFRS(I) 9 Financial Instruments (“SFRS(I) 9”). ECL on non-credit-impaired loans to customers In respect of the ECL on non-credit impaired loans to customers (S$2,571 million), the Group utilises models which are reliant on internal and external data as well as a number of estimates.

These controls include: • review and approval of forward-looking information and macroeconomic assumptions used in the ECL models; • use of reliable and accurate critical data elements in the ECL models; • review and approval of the ECL results, including post-model adjustments and management overlays applied; • independent validation of the ECL models and re view of model validation results by management; and • general IT controls over the ECL system as well as IT application controls over the completeness and accuracy of data flows from source systems to the ECL systems. We determined that we could rely on these controls for the purposes of our audit. For a sample of the Group’s ECL models, we examined the model methodologies and assessed the reasonableness of key judgements and assumptions made by management in the model and parameters used. We also reviewed the results of independent model validation conducted by the Group’s model validation function as part of our assessment of the ECL models. We also assessed the reasonableness of criteria used to determine a SICR and accuracy and timeliness of allocation of exposures into Stage 1 and Stage 2 based on quantitative and qualitative criteria. Through the course of our work, we challenged the rationale and calculation basis of post-model adjustments and management overlays. Overall, we assessed the methodologies and key assumptions made by the Group to estimate the ECL on non-credit impaired loans to customers to be reasonable.\nKey Audit Matter How Our Audit Addressed the Key Audit Matter Impairment of loans to customers (continued) ECL on credit-impaired loans to customers As at 31 December 2023, the allowances on credit-impaired loans to customers of the Group are S$1,328 million, a significant portion of which relates to the Global Wholesale Banking (“GWB”) loan portfolio. We focused on this area because of the highly subjective judgements and assumptions applied by management in determining the necessity for, and estimating the amount of, the ECL allowances against credit-impaired loans to customers. Significant judgements were also required for the credit grading of borrowers in accordance with MAS Notice 612. For GWB’s credit-impaired loan portfolio, significant management judgement and estimation include: • identifying credit-impaired exposures; • assessing the future pe rformance of the borrowers and recoverable cash flows; and • determining collateral values and timing of realisation.ECL on credit-impaired loans to customersWe assessed the design effectiveness and tested the operating effectiveness of key controls over credit grading, credit monitoring and management’s determination of the ECL allowances for loans to customers.

We determined that we could rely on these controls for the purposes of our audit. We selected a sample of credit exposures in the GWB loan portfolio and performed credit file reviews to assess the appropriateness of credit grading in accordance with the requirements of MAS Notice 612. In that process, we have also considered management’s assessment on the impact of current significant events in the identification of credit-impaired exposures. Where there was objective evidence of impairment, we assessed whether the ECL allowances were recognised on a timely basis and evaluated the amount of such impairment. Our work includes: • considering the background facts and the latest circumstance s in relation to the borrower; • examining and challenging management’s key assumptions applied on expected future cash flows of the borrower, including amounts and timing of recoveries; • comparing the realisable value of collateral against externally derived evidence including independent valuation reports, where available; and • testing the calculation of impairment. F or a sample of non-credit impaired loans to customers which had not been classified by management as credit-impaired, we challenged management’s key assumptions on whether their classification was appropriate, based on our understanding of the customers, business environment and other external evidence where available. Based on the procedures performed, we have assessed that the ECL allowances for credit-impaired loans to customers were within an acceptable range of estimates.\nKey Audit Matter How Our Audit Addressed the Key Audit Matter Valuation of financial instruments measured at fair value – Levels 2 and 3(Refer to Notes 2.20 and 41.3 to the financial statements) As at 31 December 2023, the Group had financial assets of S$79,100 million and financial liabilities of S$15,092 million measured at fair value which were classified as Level 2. These represent 41% of the financial assets and 94% of the financial liabilities measured at fair value respectively. We considered valuation of Level 2 financial instruments to be a key audit matter due to their financial significance to the Group as well as the judgement required in relation to the application of the appropriate models, assumptions and inputs. The Group also had financial assets of S$6,230 million and financial liabilities of S$616 million measured at fair value which were classified as Level 3. These represent 3% of the financial assets and 4% of the financial liabilities measured at fair value respectively. We focused on the valuation of Level 3 financial assets and financial liabilities as management makes significant judgements and assumptions when valuing these financial instruments, as they are complex or illiquid and the external evidence supporting the Group’s valuations are limited due to the lack of a liquid market.We assessed the design and tested the operating effectiveness of key controls over the Group’s financial instruments valuation processes, including the controls over: • management’s testing and approval of new valuation models including revalidation of existing models; • the completeness and accuracy of the data feeds and othe r inputs into valuation models; • monitoring of collateral dispute s; and •", "bank": "OCBC", "year": "2023"}

As at 31 December 2023, the carrying amount of goodwill on the Group’s balance sheet amounted to S$4,403 million. In performing the impairment assessment of the carrying amount of goodwill, significant judgement is made by management in estimating the recoverable amounts of the relevant cash generating units (“CGUs”).

On 1 January 2023, the Group adopted SFRS(I) 17 Insurance Contracts (“SFRS(I) 17”). The standard sets out the requirements that an entity should apply in accounting for insurance contracts it issues, reinsurance contracts it holds and investment contracts with discretionary participating features it issues. Insurance contract liabilities under SFRS(I) 17 are measured as the total of fulfilment cash flows and contractual service margin (“CSM”), the determination of which requires judgement and interpretation. This includes the selection of accounting policies and the use of complex methodologies which are applied in actuarial models. The selection and application of appropriate methodologies requires significant professional judgement. It also requires the determination of assumptions which involve estimation uncertainty. The CSM represents the unearned profit that the Group will recognise as it provides insurance contract services in the future. The release of CSM of a group of contracts is recognised as insurance revenue in the income statement of the Group based on the number of coverage units provided in the period. Coverage units in turn are determined by the quantity of the benefits provided under a contract and its expected coverage duration. Management applied judgement in the identification of the service provided and the determination of the coverage units.We performed the following procedures to address this matter: • we assessed the adhe rence of the accounting policies adopted by management with the requirements in SFRS(I) 17; • we understood the proce ss over the selection of accounting policies, determination of methodologies and assumptions, and reconciliation of data used in determining the insurance contract liabilities; • we tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the accuracy and completeness of the data used; • we assessed the appropriateness of the methodologies used in the determination of the insurance contract liabilities comprising of fulfilment cash flows and CSM, and their application in actuarial models; • we assessed the re asonableness of the key assumptions used by management by comparing against GEH Group’s historical experiences and market observable data, where applicable; • we assessed the appropriateness of management’s identification of the services provided by reviewing the terms and features of the insurance contracts issued on a sample basis; • we assessed the appropriateness of management’s determination of the coverage units against the type of service identified; and • we reviewed the reasonableness of the movement analysis of the insurance contract liabilities prepared by management. The movement analysis provides a reconciliation of the balance as at 31 December 2022 to 31 December 2023, showing the key drivers of the changes during the year. Based on the work performed and the evidence obtained, we found the methodologies, assumptions and judgements used by management to be appropriate.\nOther Information Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Directors’ Statement (but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon), which we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, and the other sections of the annual report (“the Other Sections”), which are expected to be made available to us after that date. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. When we read the Other Sections, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to the directors and take appropriate actions in accordance with SSAs. Responsibilities of Management and Directors for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I)s, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets. In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. •  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. •  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Bank and by those subsidiary corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

Critical accounting estimates and assumptions used that are significant to the financial statements, and areas involving a high degree of judgement or complexity, are disclosed in Note 2.20. The following new/revised financial reporting standards and interpretations were applied with effect from 1 January 2023:SFRS(I) Title SFRS(I) 17 Insurance Contracts Various Amendments to SFRS(I) 17 Various Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-1 and SFRS(I) Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of Accounting Policies SFRS(I) 1-8 (Amendments) Definition of Accounting Estimates SFRS(I) 1-12 (Amendments), SFRS(I) 1 (Amendments)Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction SFRS(I) 1-12 (Amendments) International Tax Reform—Pillar Two Model Rules The initial application of the above standards (including their consequential amendments) and interpretations did not have any material impact on the Group’s financial statements, except for the adoption of SFRS(I) 17 Insurance Contracts. The Group has applied SFRS(I) 17, including any consequential amendments to other standards, from 1 January 2023. The adoption of SFRS(I) 17 by the Group’s insurance subsidiary and associate has brought significant changes to the accounting policies (Note 2.13) for insurance and reinsurance contracts. The Group has restated information for the financial year 2022 for comparative purposes. A. GEH Group – SFRS(I) 17 Insurance Contracts Changes to Classification and Measurement SFRS(I) 17 establishes specific principles for the recognition and measurement of insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held by Great Eastern Holding Limited and its subsidiaries (collectively GEH Group). The key principles of SFRS(I) 17 are that GEH Group: •  Identifies insurance contracts as those under which GEH Group accepts significant", "bank": "OCBC", "year": "2023"}

An onerous contract group’s expected loss is not offset against the expected gains of other contract groups. Changes to Presentation and DisclosureFor presentation in the balance sheet, GEH Group aggregates portfolios of insurance and reinsurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held and presents separately:•  Portfolios of insurance and reinsurance contracts issued that are assets; • Portfolios of reinsurance contracts held that are assets; • Portfolios of insurance contracts that are liabilities; and • Portfolios of reinsurance contracts held that are liabilities. The portfolios referred to above are those established at initial recognition in accordance with the SFRS(I) 17 requirements. The descriptions of the line items in the consolidated income statement have been changed significantly compared with the previous year. Previously, GEH Group reported the following line items: gross premiums, gross claims, maturities, surrenders and annuities and change in insurance contract liabilities. SFRS(I) 17 requires separate presentation of:• Insurance revenue; • Insurance service expense; • Insurance finance income or expense; and • Income or expenses from reinsurance contracts held.GEH Group provides disaggregated qualitative and quantitative information in the notes to the financial statements about:•  The amounts recognised in its financial statements from insurance contracts and reinsurance contracts; and •  Significant judgements, and changes in those judgements made when applying the standard. B. GEH Group – Transition GEH Group has restated the comparative information based on the transition approaches taken on adoption of SFRS(I) 17. Changes in accounting policies resulting from the adoption of SFRS(I) 17 were applied using the fully retrospective approach to the extent practicable and the modified retrospective approach or fair value approach. The fully retrospective approach was applied to insurance contracts that were originated less than one year prior to the effective date. Where it was not possible to obtain all required historical data without undue cost and effort, the modified retrospective approach or fair value approach was applied. The modified retrospective approach was applied to certain groups of insurance contracts that were originated less than 10 years prior to the transition date. The fair value approach was applied to the remaining insurance contracts in force at transition date. On transition date, at 1 January 2022, GEH Group: •  Identified, recognised and measured each group of insurance and reinsurance contracts as if SFRS(I) 17 had always been applied unless impracticable; •  Derecognised previously reported balances that would not have existed if SFRS(I) 17 had always been applied; •  Elected the option introduced by SFRS(I) 17 to redesignate certain financial assets to address possible accounting mismatches between financial assets and insurance contract liabilities, and applied the classifications retrospectively; and • Recognised any resulting net difference in equity.\n2.

This approach is used for non-life insurance contracts, because each of these contracts has a coverage period of one year or less, or meets the eligibility criteria. Besides the impact on equity upon transition, there are also other changes in the balance sheet mainly resulting from insurance related receivables and payables now included within fulfilment cash flows instead of being presented separately. Redesignation of Financial Assets and Classification Overlay SFRS(I) 17 allows entities that had applied SFRS(I) 9 to annual periods before the initial application of SFRS(I) 17, to redesignate its financial assets to address possible accounting mismatches between financial assets and insurance contract liabilities. A transition option was elected to apply a classification overlay for the financial assets as if the classification and measurement requirements of SFRS(I) 9 had been applied to that financial asset during the comparative period. At the transition date, the Group elected the option to redesignate debt instruments held with a carrying amount of $2,094 million from fair value through profit or loss to fair value through other comprehensive income.\n2.  Material Accounting Policy Information (continued) 2.2 Basis of Consolidation 2.2.1 Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group controls when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date when control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated on the date when that control ceases. The Group reassesses whether it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there have been changes to its power, its rights to variable returns or its ability to use its power to affect its returns. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, intra-group transactions and balances, together with unrealised income and expenses arising from the intra-group transactions among group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to ensure consistency of accounting policies within the Group. Non-controlling interests (NCI) represent the equity in subsidiaries not attributable, directly or indirectly, to shareholders of the Bank, and are presented separately from equity attributable to equity holders of the Bank. For NCI that arise through minority unit holders’ interest in the insurance subsidiaries of Great Eastern Holdings Limited (GEH) consolidated investment funds, they are recognised as a liability. These interests qualify as a financial liability as they give the holder the right to put the instrument back to the issuer for cash. Changes in these liabilities are recognised in the income statement as expenses. The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued or liabilities incurred or assumed at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any NCI at the NCI’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of the sum of consideration transferred, the recognised amount of any NCI in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair values of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill at the date of acquisition. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the income statements. Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under the control of the shareholder that controls the Group are accounted for as if the acquisition has occurred at the beginning of the earliest comparative year presented or, if later, at the date that common control was established; for this purpose comparatives are reclassified. The assets and liabilities acquired are recognised at the carrying amounts recognised previously in the Group controlling shareholder’s consolidated financial statements. The components of equity of the acquired entities are added to the same components within the Group’s equity and any gain/loss arising is recognised directly in equity. 2.2.2 Structured Entities A structured entity is an entity in which voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding control and is generally established for a narrow and well-defined objective. For the purpose of disclosure, the Group is considered to be the sponsor of a structured entity if it has a key role in establishing the structured entity or its name appears in the overall structure of the structured entity. 2.2.3 Associates and Joint Ventures Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies of these entities. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds 20% or more of the voting power of another entity. Joint ventures are arrangements to undertake economic activities in which the Group has joint control and rights to the net assets of the entities. Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for in the Bank’s financial statements at cost and in the Group’s consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting (equity accounting). If the investment in an associate is held by, or is held indirectly through, an entity that is a venture capital organisation, or a mutual fund, unit trust and similar entities including investment-linked insurance funds, the Group may elect to measure that investment at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with SFRS(I) 9 Financial Instruments. The Group will make this election separately for each associate, at initial recognition of the associate.\n2.  Material Accounting Policy Information (continued) 2.2 Basis of Preparation (continued) 2.2.3 Associates and Joint Ventures (continued) Under equity accounting, the investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is adjusted for post-acquisition changes of the Group’s share of the net assets of the entity until the date the significant influence or joint control ceases. The Group’s investment in associates and joint ventures includes goodwill identified on acquisition, where applicable. When the Group’s share of losses equals or exceeds its interests in the associates and joint ventures, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the entities. In applying equity accounting, unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interests in these entities. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of associates and joint ventures to ensure consistency of accounting policies with those of the Group. The results of associates and joint ventures are taken from audited financial statements or unaudited management accounts of the entities concerned, made up to dates of not more than three months prior to the reporting date of the Group. The investment in an associate or joint venture is derecognised when the Group ceases to have significant influence or joint control, respectively, over the investee. Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI) in respect of the investee are transferred to the income statement. Any retained interest in the entity is re-measured at its fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the retained interest at the date when significant influence or joint control ceases, and its corresponding fair value, is recognised in the income statement. 2.2.4  Investments in Subsidiaries, Associates and Joint Ventures by the Bank These investments are stated in the Bank’s balance sheet at cost less any impairment in value after the date of acquisition. 2.3 Currency Translation 2.3.1 Foreign Currency Transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in the respective functional currencies of the Bank and its subsidiaries at the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction dates. Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the respective entities’ functional currencies at the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on settlement and translation of such items are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary items denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rate on the date the fair value is determined. Exchange differences on non-monetary items such as equity investments classified as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) financial assets are recognised in OCI and presented in the fair value reserve within equity. 2.3.2 Foreign Operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustment arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation, are translated to Singapore Dollar at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to Singapore Dollar at average exchange rates for the year, which approximate the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Differences arising from the translation of a foreign operation are recognised in OCI and presented in the currency translation reserve within equity. When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in full, the relevant amount in the currency translation reserve is included in the income statement on disposal of the operation. 2.4 Cash and Cash Equivalents In the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, money market placements, reverse repo and other balances with central banks which are generally short-term financial instruments or repayable on demand. 2.5 Financial Instruments 2.5.1 RecognitionThe Group initially recognises derivative financial instruments (forwards, futures, swaps and options) on the trade date. It initially recognises non-derivative financial instruments (loans and advances, deposits and debts issued, and regular way purchases and sales of financial assets) on the settlement date. Regular-way purchases and sales are those settled within the time period established by regulation or market convention. 2.5.2 De-Recognition Financial assets are de-recognised when the Group’s contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or when the Group transfers the financial asset to another party without retaining control or transfers substantially all the", "bank": "OCBC", "year": "2023"}
{"section_title": "risks and rewards of ownership of the asset. Financial liabilities are de-recognised", "content": "risks and rewards of ownership of the asset. Financial liabilities are de-recognised when the Group’s obligations specified in the contract expire or are discharged or cancelled.\n2.  Material Accounting Policy Information (continued) 2.5 Financial Instruments (continued) 2.5.3 Modifications The original terms of a financial instrument may be renegotiated or otherwise modified, resulting in changes to its contractual cash flows. Where the extent of changes as a result of the modification or renegotiation is substantial, the existing financial instrument is derecognised and a new instrument (with new terms including a new effective interest rate) recognised. In all other cases, the modified contractual cash flows of the existing instrument are discounted at the original effective interest rate to arrive at a new carrying amount and the resulting modification gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (IBOR Reform) If the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability measured at amortised cost changes as a result of IBOR reform, the Group updates the effective interest rate of the financial asset or financial liability to reflect the change that is required by the reform. A change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows is required by IBOR reform if the following conditions are met:•  the change is necessary as a direct consequence of the reform; and •  the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis, i.e. the basis immediately before the change. If there are changes to the terms of a financial asset or financial liability in addition to changes to the basis for determining the contractual cash flows required by interest rate benchmark reform, the Group first updates the effective interest rate of the financial asset or financial liability to reflect the change that is required by interest rate benchmark reform and then applies the accounting policy for modifications set out above to account for the additional changes. 2.5.4 Offsetting Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the amounts and an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted by the accounting standards. 2.5.5  Sale and Repurchase Agreements (Including Securities Lending and Borrowing) Repurchase agreements (repos) are regarded as collateralised borrowing. The securities sold under repos are treated as pledged assets and remain as assets on the balance sheets. The amount borrowed is recorded as a liability. Reverse repos are treated as collateralised lending and the amount of securities purchased is included in placements with central banks, loans to banks and non-bank customers. The difference between the amount received and the amount paid under repos and reverse repos is amortised as interest expense and interest income respectively using the effective interest rate method. Securities lending and borrowing transactions are generally secured, with collateral taking the form of securities or cash. The transfer of securities to or from counterparties is not reflected on the balance sheet. Cash collateral paid or received is recorded as an asset or a liability respectively. 2.6 Non-Derivative Financial Assets Classification and Measurement of Financial AssetsA non-derivative financial asset is initially recognised at fair value and is subsequently measured either at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Directly attributable transaction costs are included as part of the initial cost for financial instruments that are not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. (a) Business Model Assessment The Group makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed, and information is provided to management. The information considered includes:•  the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In particular, whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual interest income, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets; •  how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group’s management; •  the", "bank": "OCBC", "year": "2023"}

However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Group’s stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.\n2.  Material Accounting Policy Information (continued) 2.6 Non-Derivative Financial Assets (continued) Classification and Measurement of Financial Assets (continued) (a) Business Model Assessment (continued) Financial assets that are held for trading and whose performance is evaluated or managed on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are neither within the business model to hold the assets to collect contractual cash flows, nor within the business model to hold the assets both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell.

Debt instruments classified as amortised cost are subject to impairment assessment using the expected credit loss model in accordance with SFRS(I) 9. Interest earned whilst holding the financial assets is included in interest income. 2.6.2 Debt Instruments Measured at FVOCI A debt financial instrument is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated at FVTPL: •  it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial asset; and •  its contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding. Debt instruments classified as FVOCI are subject to impairment assessment using the expected credit loss model in accordance with SFRS(I) 9. Interest earned while holding the financial assets is included in interest income.At the reporting date, the Group recognises unrealised fair value gains and losses on revaluing these assets in OCI and presents the cumulative gains and losses in fair value reserve within equity, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses, which are recognised in the income statement. At maturity or upon disposal, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised  in OCI is reclassified from fair value reserve to the income statement. 2.6.3 Debt Instruments Measured at FVTPL Debt instruments that do not meet the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI are measured at FVTPL. At the reporting date, the Group recognises realised and unrealised gains and losses as trading income in the income statement. Interest earned while holding the assets is included in interest income. 2.6.4 Designation at FVTPL On initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset at FVTPL notwithstanding that it would otherwise meet the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI, if doing so, it eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. Upon designation, financial assets are measured at fair value on each reporting date until maturity or derecognition. Realised and unrealised fair value changes are recognised in the income statement. 2.6.5 Equity Instruments Equity instruments held for trading are classified as FVTPL. Equity instruments that are not held for trading may be classified as FVOCI based on an irrevocable election on initial recognition on an investment-by-investment basis. At the reporting date, realised and unrealised fair value gains or losses on revaluing the equity instruments classified as FVTPL are recognised in the income statement. Realised and unrealised fair value gains or losses on revaluing the equity instruments classified as FVOCI are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to the income statement. Dividend earned while holding the equity instruments classified as FVTPL is recognised as dividend income in the income statement. Dividend from equity instruments classified as FVOCI is recognised as dividend income in the income statement unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. 2.6.6 Reclassification Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period when the Group changes its business model for managing its financial assets.\n2.  Material Accounting Policy Information (continued) 2.7 Derivative Financial Instruments All derivative financial instruments are recognised initially and subsequently measured at fair value on the balance sheet as an asset or liability depending on whether it is a receivable or a payable, respectively.

In a cash flow hedging relationship, the Group mainly uses cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in the cash flows of variable rate asset or liability resulting from changes in interest rates, either in a one to one hedging relationship or on a portfolio basis. For qualifying cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative is recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.

Gains and losses accumulated in equity are transferred to income statement on disposal of the foreign operations. The main source of ineffectiveness for the Group’s net investment hedge is the use of a hedging instrument denominated in a proxy currency that is not perfectly correlated to the actual currency to which the Group is exposed.\n2.

The Group will cease to apply the specific policy for assessing the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument when the uncertainty arising from IBOR reform is no longer present with respect to the timing and the amount of the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item or hedging instrument, or when the hedging relationship is discontinued. When the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of the hedged item or hedging instrument changes as a result of IBOR reform, the Group amends the hedge documentation of that hedging relationship to reflect the change(s) required by IBOR reform.

If the additional changes do not result in the discontinuation of the hedge accounting relationship, then the Group amends the formal hedge documentation for changes required by IBOR reform as mentioned above. 2.8 Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment includes the purchase price and costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.Subsequent expenditure relating to property, plant and equipment is added to the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits, in excess of the standard of performance of the asset before the expenditure was made, will flow to the Group and the cost can be reliably measured. Other subsequent expenditure is recognised in the income statement during the financial year in which the expenditure is incurred. The residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods of property, plant and equipment are reviewed and adjusted as appropriate, at each reporting date, to ensure that they reflect the expected economic benefits derived from these assets. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:Furniture and fixtures  – 5 to 10 years Office equipment   – 5 to 10 years Computers    – 3 to 10 years Renovation    –   8 years or remaining lease term, whichever is shorter Motor vehicles   – 5 years Freehold land and leasehold land with leases of more than 100 years to expiry are not depreciated. Buildings and other leasehold land are depreciated over 50 years or the period of the lease, whichever is shorter. An item of property, plant and equipment is de-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefit is expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset is included in the income statement in the year the asset is de-recognised. 2.9 Investment Property Investment property is property held either for rental income or for capital appreciation or for both. Investment properties, other than those held under the Group’s life insurance funds, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Freehold land and leasehold land with leases of more than 100 years to expiry are not depreciated. Buildings and other leasehold land are depreciated over 50 years or the period of the lease, whichever is shorter. Investment property held under the Group’s life insurance funds is stated at fair value at the reporting date and collectively form an asset class which is an integral part of the overall investment strategy for the asset-liability management of the life insurance business. The fair value of the investment property is determined based on objective valuations undertaken by independent valuers at the reporting date. Changes in the carrying amount resulting from revaluation are recognised in the consolidated income statement.\n2.  Material Accounting Policy Information (continued) 2.10 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 2.10.1 Goodwill Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries represents the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previously held equity interest over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is stated at cost less impairment loss. Impairment test is carried out annually, or when there is indication that the goodwill may be impaired. Gains or losses on disposal of subsidiaries and associates include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. 2.10.2 Intangible Assets Intangible assets other than goodwill are separately identifiable intangible items arising from acquisitions and are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives range from 6 to 20 years. The useful life of an intangible asset is reviewed at least at each financial year end. 2.11 Impairment of Assets (I)  Financial Assets Impairment allowances for financial assets are assessed using a forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) model in accordance with the requirements of SFRS(I) 9. 2.11.1 Scope Under SFRS(I) 9, the ECL model is applied to debt financial assets measured at amortised cost or FVOCI and off-balance sheet loan commitments and financial guarantees. 2.11.2 Expected Credit Loss Impairment Model Under SFRS(I) 9, credit loss allowances are measured on each reporting date according to a three-stage expected credit loss impairment model:•  Stage 1 – On initial recognition and at a subsequent reporting date, where there is no significant increase in a financial asset or off-balance sheet exposure’s credit", "bank": "OCBC", "year": "2023"}

They are measured based on the present value of the cash shortfalls as elaborated below:(a)  Financial assets that are not credit-impaired (Stage 1 and Stage 2) at the reporting date: The contractual cash flows due to the Group less the cash flows that the Group expects to receive; (b)  Financial assets that are credit-impaired (Stage 3) at the reporting date: The gross carrying amount less the cash flows that the Group expects to receive; (c)  Undrawn loan commitments: The contractual cash flows due to the Group if the commitment is drawn down less the cash flows that the Group expects to receive; and (d)  Financial guarantee contracts: The expected cash outflows under the guarantee less the cash flows that the Group expects to recover. The key inputs used in the measurement of ECL are:•  Probability of default (PD) – This is an estimate (as a percentage) of the likelihood of default over 12 months or the exposure’s expected life time. •  Loss given default (LGD) – This is an estimate (as a percentage) of the loss arising on default. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the Group would expect to receive, including from any collateral. •  Exposure at default (EAD) – This is an estimate (as an amount) of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest as well as expected drawdowns on committed facilities. For Stage 1 exposures, ECL is calculated by multiplying the 12-month PD by LGD and EAD. For Stage 2 and Stage 3 exposures, ECL is calculated by multiplying lifetime PD by LGD and EAD.

If a modified financial asset results in derecognition, the new financial asset will be recognised under Stage 1, unless it is assessed to be credit-impaired at the time of the modification. 2.11.5 Regulatory Requirement Under MAS 612 requirement, the Group is required to maintain a minimum regulatory loss allowance (MRLA) of 1% of the gross carrying amount of the specified credit exposures, net of collateral. Where the accounting loss allowance of selected non-credit-impaired exposures computed under SFRS(I) 9 is less than the MRLA, the Group must maintain the difference in a non-distributable regulatory loss allowance reserve (RLAR) account through the appropriation of revenue reserves. Where the aggregated accounting loss allowance and RLAR exceeds the MRLA, the Group may transfer the excess amount in the RLAR to revenue reserves.\n2.  Material Accounting Policy Information (continued) 2.11 Impairment of Assets (continued) (II)  Other Assets 2.11.6 Goodwill For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s Cash Generating Units (CGU) expected to benefit from synergies of the business combination. Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGUs (Note 36) at a level at or below the business segments identified for business segment reporting (Note 37). Impairment loss on goodwill cannot be reversed in subsequent periods. 2.11.7 Investments in Subsidiaries and Associates Property, Plant and Equipment Investment Property  Intangible AssetsInvestments in subsidiaries and associates, property, plant and equipment, investment property and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment on the reporting date or whenever there is any indication that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such an indication exists, the carrying amount of the asset is written down to its recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use). The impairment loss is recognised in the income statement, and is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The carrying amount of an asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) if no impairment loss had been recognised for the asset in prior years. 2.12 Financial Liabilities A non-derivative financial liability is initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs and is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method except where it is designated as FVTPL.

GEH Group does not have any contracts that fall under this category. Contracts are subject to different requirements depending on whether they are classified as direct participating contracts or contracts without direct participation features. Insurance contracts with direct participation features are insurance contracts that are substantially investment-related service contracts under which GEH Group promises an investment return based on underlying items; they are contracts for which, at inception:•  the contractual terms specify that the policyholder participates in a share of a clearly identified pool of underlying items; •  GEH Group expects to pay to the policyholder an amount equal to a substantial share of the fair value returns on the underlying items; and •  GEH Group expects a substantial proportion of any change in the amounts to be paid to the policyholder to vary with the change in fair value of the underlying items.\n2.  Material Accounting Policy Information (continued) 2.13  Insurance and Reinsurance Contracts (continued) 2.13.1 Definition and Classification (continued) Direct participating contracts issued by GEH Group are contracts with direct participation features where GEH Group holds the pool of underlying assets and accounts for these group of contracts under the Variable Fee Approach (VFA). The VFA modifies the accounting model in SFRS(I) 17 to reflect that the consideration that GEH Group receives for the contracts is a variable fee. All other insurance contracts and all reinsurance contracts are classified as contracts without direct participation features. Some of these contracts are measured under the PAA model (see Note 2.13.7). The PAA is an optional simplified measurement model in SFRS(I) 17 that is available for insurance and reinsurance contracts that meet the eligibility criteria. This approach is used for non-life insurance contracts, because each of these contracts have a coverage period of one year or less, or otherwise meets the eligibility criteria. 2.13.2  Separating Components from Insurance and Reinsurance Contracts GEH Group assesses its insurance and reinsurance contracts to determine whether they contain components which must be accounted for under another SFRS(I) rather than SFRS(I) 17 (distinct non-insurance components). After separating any distinct components, GEH Group applies SFRS(I) 17 to all remaining components of the (host) insurance contract. Currently, GEH Group’s contracts do not include distinct components that require separation. Some life contracts issued by GEH Group include a surrender option under which the surrender value is paid to the policyholder on maturity or earlier lapse of the contract. These surrender options have been assessed to meet the definition of a non-distinct investment component in SFRS(I) 17. SFRS(I) 17 defines investment components as the amounts that an insurance contract requires an insurer to repay to a policyholder in all circumstances, regardless of whether an insured event has occurred. Investment components which are highly interrelated with the insurance contract of which they form a part are considered non-distinct and are not separately accounted for. However, receipts and payments of the investment components are excluded from insurance revenue and insurance service expenses. The surrender options are considered non-distinct investment components as GEH Group is unable to measure the value of the surrender option component separately from the life insurance portion of the contract. For premium refund or experience refund components which are not subject to any conditions in the contracts, these have been assessed to be highly interrelated with the insurance component of the reinsurance contracts and are, therefore, non-distinct investment components which are not accounted for separately. However, receipts and payments of these investment components are recognised outside of profit or loss. 2.13.3 Level of Aggregation 2.13.3.1 Insurance Contracts Insurance contracts are aggregated into groups for measurement purposes.

These groups represent the level of aggregation at which insurance contracts are initially recognised and measured. The profitability groupings are not reassessed under subsequent remeasurement.

Applying the grouping requirements to reinsurance contracts held, GEH Group aggregates reinsurance contracts into quarterly cohorts (by quarter of issuance) for life reinsurance treaties or into annual cohort (by year of issuance) for non-life reinsurance contracts into groups of:(i)  contracts for which there is a net gain at initial recognition, if any; (ii)  contracts for which, at initial recognition, there is no significant possibility of a net gain arising subsequently; and (iii) remaining contracts in the portfolio, if any. Reinsurance contracts held are assessed for aggregation requirements on an individual reinsurance treaty basis. 2.13.4 Recognition A group of insurance contracts issued by GEH Group is recognised from the earliest of:•  the beginning of its coverage period (i.e. the period during which GEH Group provides services in respect of any premiums within the contract boundary (Note 2.13.5); •  when the first payment from the policyholder becomes due or, if there is no contractual due date, when it is received from the policyholder; and •  when facts and circumstances indicate that the contract is onerous. GEH Group recognises a group of reinsurance contracts held from the earliest of the following:•  the beginning of the coverage period of the group of reinsurance contracts held. However, GEH Group delays the recognition of a group of reinsurance contracts held that provide proportionate coverage until the date when any underlying insurance contract is initially recognised, if that date is later than the beginning of the coverage period of the group of reinsurance contracts held; and •  the date GEH Group recognises an onerous group of underlying insurance contracts if GEH Group entered into the related reinsurance contract in the group of reinsurance contracts held at or before that date. Only contracts that individually meet the recognition criteria by the end of the reporting period are included in the groups. When contracts meet the recognition criteria in the groups after the reporting date, they are added to the groups in the reporting period in which they meet the recognition criteria, or, if the contract does not qualify for inclusion in an existing group, it forms a new group to which future contracts are added. Composition of the groups is not reassessed in subsequent periods. 2.13.5 Contract Boundary GEH Group includes in the measurement of a group of insurance contracts all the future cash flows within the boundary of each contract in the group.

At initial recognition, the CSM is an amount that results in no income or expenses (unless a group of contracts is onerous or insurance revenue and insurance service expenses are recognised as in (d) below) arising from:a) the initial recognition of the FCF; b)  cash flows arising from the contracts in the group at that date; c)  the derecognition of any insurance acquisition cash flows asset; and d)  the derecognition of any other pre-recognition cash flows.

For groups of reinsurance contracts held, any net gain or loss at initial recognition is recognised as the CSM unless the net cost of purchasing reinsurance relates to past events, in which case GEH Group recognises the net cost immediately in profit or loss. For reinsurance contracts held, the CSM represents a deferred gain or loss that GEH Group will recognise as a reinsurance expense as it receives insurance contract services from the reinsurer in the future and is calculated as the sum of:a)  the initial recognition of the FCF; b)  cash flows arising from the contracts in the group at that date; c)  the amount derecognised at the date of initial recognition of any asset or liability previously recognised for cash flows related to the group of reinsurance contracts held (other pre-recognition cash flows); and d)  any income recognised in profit or loss when the entity recognises a loss on initial recognition of an onerous group of underlying insurance contracts or on addition of onerous underlying insurance contracts to that group.\n2.

When a loss component exists, GEH Group allocates the following between the loss component and the remaining component of the LRC for the respective group of contracts, based on the ratio of the loss component to the FCF relating to the expected future cash outflows:a)  expected incurred claims and other directly attributable expenses for the period; b)  changes in the", "bank": "OCBC", "year": "2023"}

Increases in the FCF in subsequent periods increase the loss component. 2.13.6.5 Reinsurance Contracts GEH Group applies the same accounting policies to measure a group of reinsurance contracts, with the following modifications. The carrying amount of a group of reinsurance contracts at each reporting date is the sum of the asset for remaining coverage (ARC) and the asset for incurred claims (AIC). The ARC comprises (a) the FCF that relate to services that will be received under the contracts in future periods and (b) any remaining CSM at that date.

For groups of reinsurance contracts held, any net gain or loss at initial recognition is recognised as the CSM unless the net cost of purchasing reinsurance relates to past events, in which case GEH Group recognises the net cost immediately in profit or loss. For reinsurance contracts held, the CSM represents a deferred gain or loss that GEH Group recognises as a reinsurance income or expenses as it receives insurance contract services from the reinsurer in the future.\n2.  Material Accounting Policy Information (continued) 2.13  Insurance and Reinsurance Contracts (continued) 2.13.6 Measurement (continued) 2.13.6.5 Reinsurance Contracts (continued) A loss-recovery component is established or adjusted within the remaining coverage for reinsurance contracts held for the amount of income recognised above. This amount is calculated by multiplying the loss recognised on underlying insurance contracts by the percentage of claims on underlying insurance contracts that GEH Group expects to recover from the reinsurance contracts held that are entered into before or at the same time as the loss is recognised on the underlying insurance contracts. 2.13.6.6 Insurance Acquisition Cash Flows Insurance acquisition cash flows arise from the costs of selling, underwriting and starting a group of insurance contracts that are directly attributable to the portfolio of insurance contracts to which the group belongs. If insurance acquisition cash flows are directly attributable to a group of contracts, they are allocated to that group. Insurance acquisition cash flows are allocated to groups of insurance contracts on a systematic and rational basis. Insurance acquisition cash flows that are directly attributable to a group of insurance contracts are allocated to that group; and to groups that will include insurance contracts that are expected to arise from renewals of the insurance contracts in that group. Insurance acquisition cash flows not directly attributable to a group of contracts but directly attributable to a portfolio of contracts are allocated to groups of contracts in the portfolio or expected to be in the portfolio. The insurance acquisition cash flows that arise before the recognition of the related insurance contracts are recognised as separate assets and tested for recoverability, whereas other insurance acquisition cash flows are included in the estimates of the present value of future cash flows as part of the measurement of the related insurance contracts. GEH Group assesses at each reporting date whether facts and circumstances indicate that an asset for insurance acquisition cash flows may be impaired, and:a)  recognises an impairment loss in profit or loss so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed the expected net cash inflow for the related group; and b)  if the asset relates to future renewals, recognises an impairment loss in profit or loss to the extent that it expects those insurance acquisition cash flows to exceed the net cash inflow for the expected renewals and this excess has not already been recognised as an impairment loss under (a).GEH Group reverses any impairment losses in profit or loss and increases the carrying amount of the asset to the extent that the impairment conditions no longer exist or have improved. 2.13.7 Measurement – Contracts Measured Under the PAA For insurance contracts issued, on initial recognition, GEH Group measures the LRC at the amount of premiums received, less any acquisition cash flows paid and any amounts arising from the derecognition of the insurance acquisition cash flows asset and the derecognition of any other relevant pre-recognition cash flows.

Where, during the coverage period, facts and circumstances indicate that a group of insurance contracts is onerous, GEH Group recognises a loss in profit or loss for the net outflow, resulting in the carrying amount of the liability for the group being equal to the FCF. A loss component is established by GEH Group for the LRC for such onerous group depicting the losses recognised. For reinsurance contracts held, on initial recognition, GEH Group measures the remaining coverage at the amount of ceding premiums paid net of commission, plus broker fees paid to a party other than the reinsurer. The carrying amount of a group of insurance contracts issued at the end of each reporting period is the sum of the LRC and the LIC, comprising the FCF related to past service allocated to the group at the reporting date. The carrying amount of a group of reinsurance contracts held at the end of each reporting period is the sum of the ARC and the AIC, comprising the FCF related to past service allocated to the group at the reporting date.

When an insurance contract is modified by GEH Group as a result of an agreement with the counterparties or due to a change in regulations, GEH Group treats changes in cash flows caused by the modification as changes in estimates of the FCF, unless the conditions for the derecognition of the original contract are met. GEH Group derecognises the original contract and recognises the modified contract as a new contract if any of the following conditions are present: a)  if the modified terms had been included at contract inception and GEH Group would have concluded that the modified contract:i. is not within the scope of SFRS(I) 17; ii. results in different separable components; iii. results in a different contract boundary; or iv. belongs to a different group of contracts; b)  the original contract represents an insurance contract with direct participation features, but the modified contract no longer meets that definition, or vice versa; orc)  the original contract was accounted for under the PAA, but the modification means that the contract no longer meets the eligibility criteria for that approach. When a new contract is required to be recognised as a result of modification and it is within the scope of SFRS(I) 17, the new contract is recognised from the date of modification and is assessed for, amongst other things, contract classification, including the VFA eligibility component separation requirements (see Note 2.13.2) and contract aggregation requirements (see Note 2.13.3).

The amount of insurance revenue recognised in the reporting period depicts the transfer of promised services at an amount that reflects the portion of consideration that GEH Group expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. For contracts not measured under the PAA, the insurance revenue comprises the following items. • Amounts relating to the changes in the LRC: a)  expected claims and other directly attributable expenses incurred in the period measured at the amounts expected at the beginning of the period, excluding:• amounts allocated to the loss component; •  repayments of investment components and policyholder rights to withdraw an amount; •  amounts of transaction-based taxes collected in a fiduciary capacity; • insurance acquisition expenses; and •  amounts related to the", "bank": "OCBC", "year": "2023"}

For groups of insurance contracts measured under the PAA, GEH Group recognises insurance revenue based on the passage of time over the coverage of a group of contracts. Insurance Service Expenses Insurance service expenses include the following:•  Incurred claims and benefits, excluding investment components reduced by loss components allocations; •  other incurred directly attributable expenses, including amounts of any other pre-recognition cash flows assets (other than insurance acquisition cash flows) derecognised at the date of initial recognition; •  Insurance acquisition cash flows amortisation; •  changes that relate to past service – changes in the FCF relating to the LIC; •  changes that relate to future service – changes in the FCF that results in onerous contract losses or reversals of those losses; and • insurance acquisition cash flows assets impairment. For contracts not measured under the PAA, amortisation of insurance acquisition cash flows is reflected in insurance service expenses in the same amount as insurance acquisition cash flows recovery reflected within insurance revenue, as described above. For contracts measured under the PAA, amortisation of insurance acquisition cash flows is reflected in insurance service expenses based on the passage of time. Other expenses not meeting the above categories are included in other operating expenses in the consolidated income statement. Net Income/(Expenses) from Reinsurance Contracts Held GEH Group presents financial performance of groups of reinsurance contracts held on a net basis in net income/(expenses) from reinsurance contracts held, comprising the following amounts:a) reinsurance expenses; b)  for groups of reinsurance contracts measured under the PAA, broker fees are included within reinsurance expenses; c)  incurred claims recovery, excluding investment components reduced by loss-recovery component allocations; d)  other incurred directly attributable expenses; e)  changes that relate to past service – changes in the FCF relating to incurred claims recovery; and\n2.

Reinsurance expenses are recognised similarly to insurance revenue. The amount of reinsurance expenses recognised in the reporting period depicts the transfer of received insurance contract services at an amount that reflects the portion of ceding premiums that GEH Group expects to pay in exchange for those services. Additionally, for reinsurance contracts held measured under the PAA, broker fees are included in reinsurance expenses. For contracts not measured under the PAA, reinsurance expenses comprise the following amounts relating to changes in the remaining coverage:a)  claims and other directly attributable expenses recovery in the period, measured at the amounts expected to be incurred at the beginning of the period, excluding:• amounts allocated to the loss-recovery component; • repayments of investment components; and •  amounts related to the", "bank": "OCBC", "year": "2023"}

GEH Group systematically allocates expected total insurance finance income or expenses over the duration of the group of contracts to profit or loss using discount rates determined on initial recognition of the group of contracts. In the event of transfer of a group of insurance contracts or derecognition of an insurance contract, GEH Group reclassifies the insurance finance income or expenses to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment to any remaining amounts for the group (or contract) that were previously recognised in other comprehensive income.\n2.

Therefore, they are presented separately in the balance sheet within the line items “Investment securities for life insurance funds”, “Other assets for life insurance funds” and “Insurance contract liabilities and other liabilities for life insurance funds” respectively. 2.14 Share Capital and Dividend Ordinary shares, non-cumulative non-convertible preference shares and perpetual capital securities are classified as equity on the balance sheet. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new capital securities are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds. Where share capital recognised as equity is repurchased (treasury shares), the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is presented as a deduction from equity.

Final dividends are recorded in the year when the dividends are approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting. 2.15 Leases 2.15.1 As Lessee At the inception of a contract, the Group assesses if the contract contains a lease. A contract contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Reassessment is only required when the terms and conditions of the contract are changed. Right-of-Use Assets The Group recognises a right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liability at the date which the underlying asset is available for use. ROU assets are measured at cost which comprises the initial measurement of lease liabilities adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date and lease incentive received. Any initial direct costs that would not have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained are added to the carrying amount of the ROU assets. These ROU assets are subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the ROU asset or the end of the lease term. ROU assets are presented within “Property, plant and equipment”. Lease Liabilities The initial measurement of lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments discounted using the implicit rate in the lease, if the rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group shall use its incremental borrowing rate. Lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Lease liability shall be remeasured when there is modification in the scope or the consideration of the lease that was not part of the original term. Short-Term Leases and Low-Value Assets The Group has elected to not recognise ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have lease terms of 12 months or less and leases of low-value leases, except for sublease arrangements. Lease payments relating to these leases are expensed to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 2.15.2 As Lessor Rental income on tenanted areas of the buildings owned by the Group is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income, over the term of the lease. 2.16 Recognition of Income and Expense 2.16.1 Interest Income and Expense Interest income or expense is recognised using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or amortised cost of the financial liability. In calculating the interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability. However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.\n2.  Material Accounting Policy Information (continued) 2.16 Recognition of Income and Expense (continued) 2.16.2 Fees and Commissions The Group earns fees and commissions from a range of services rendered to its customers. Fees and commissions are recognised when the Group has satisfied its performance obligations in providing the services to the customer.

Expenses are offset against gross fees and commissions in the income statement only when they are directly related. 2.16.3 Dividends Dividends from equity securities, subsidiaries and associates are recognised when the right to receive payment is established. Dividends received from equity securities at FVTPL and FVOCI are presented in net trading income and other income respectively. 2.16.4 Employee Benefits The Group’s compensation package for staff consists of base salaries, allowances, defined contribution plans such as the Central Provident Fund, defined benefit plans, commissions, cash bonuses, and share-based compensation plans. These are recognised in the income statement when incurred. Employee leave entitlements are estimated according to the terms of employment contract and accrued on the reporting date. For defined benefit plans, the liability recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets, adjusted for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs. Remeasurements of defined benefit plans are recognised in OCI in the period in which they arise. Share-based compensation plans include the Bank’s Share Option Schemes, the Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESP Plan) and the Deferred Share Plan (DSP). Equity instruments granted are recognised as expense in the income statement based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the date of the grant. The expense is recognised over the vesting period of the grant, with corresponding entries to equity. At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of equity instruments expected to be vested, and the impact of the change to the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period. The Group accrues for interest on the monthly contributions made by employees to the savings-based ESP Plan. For the DSP, a trust is set up to administer the shares. The DSP Trust is consolidated in the Group’s financial statements. Proceeds received upon the exercise of options and acquisition rights, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital. 2.17 Income Tax Expense Income tax expense is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts used for tax computation. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that does not affect accounting or taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures to the extent that they probably will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Also, no deferred tax is recognised with respect to Pillar Two model rules published by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“Pillar Two legislation”). Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available for utilisation against the temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.\n2.  Material Accounting Policy Information (continued) 2.17 Income Tax Expense (continued) In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Group takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and prior experience. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgements about future events. New information may become available that causes the Group to change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will impact tax expense in the period that such a determination is made. 2.18 Earnings Per Share The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share data for its ordinary shares. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Bank by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for own shares held. Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise share options granted to employees. 2.19 Segment Reporting The Group’s business segments represent the key customer and product groups, as follows: Global Consumer/Private Banking, Global Wholesale Banking, Global Markets and Insurance. All operating segments’ results are reviewed regularly by the senior management to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. In determining the segment results, balance sheet items are internally transfer priced and revenues and expenses are attributed to each segment based on internal management reporting policies. Transactions between business segments are recorded within the segment as if they are third party transactions and are eliminated on consolidation.

Material Accounting Policy Information (continued) 2.20  Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements (continued) 2.20.1 Impairment of Financial Assets (continued) Sensitivity of ECL ECL is estimated to increase by $1,473 million (2022: $1,310 million) should all the exposures in Stage 1 (12-month ECL) move to Stage 2 (lifetime ECL). The Group’s allowances for financial assets are disclosed in Note 30. Allowances for Credit-Impaired Loans to Customers In respect of credit-impaired exposures, management judgement and estimation are applied in, amongst others, identifying impaired exposures, estimating the related recoverable cash flows and where applicable, determining collateral values and timing of realisation. Judgements and assumptions in respect of these matters have been updated to reflect the relevant information as of 31 December 2023. The Group’s allowances for credit-impaired loans to customers are disclosed in Note 28. 2.20.2 Fair Value Estimation Fair value is derived from quoted market prices or valuation techniques which maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) are determined by using valuation techniques. Where unobservable data inputs have a significant impact on the value obtained from the valuation model, such a financial instrument is initially recognised at the transaction price, which is the best indicator of fair value. The difference between the transaction price and the model value, commonly referred to as “day one profit or loss” is not recognised immediately in the income statement. The choice of valuation technique and the use of model inputs requires significant judgement. The timing of recognising the day one profit or loss is determined individually. It is amortised over the life of the transaction, released when the instrument’s fair value can be determined using market observable inputs, or when the transaction is derecognised.2.20.3 Insurance Business GEH Group makes estimates, assumptions and judgements in its estimates of FCF, discount rates used,", "bank": "OCBC", "year": "2023"}

The target confidence level is at 85th percentile. Estimates of Future Cash Flows In estimating future cash flows, GEH Group incorporates, in an unbiased way, all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date. This information includes both internal and external historical data about claims and other experience updated to reflect current expectations of future events. The estimates of future cash flows will reflect GEH Group’s view of current conditions at the reporting date, as long as the estimates of any relevant market variables are consistent with observable market prices. When estimating future cash flows, GEH Group takes into account current expectations of future events that might affect cash flows. Cash flows within a contract boundary are those that relate directly to the fulfilment of the contract, including those for which the GEH Group has discretion over the amount or timing. These include payments to (or on behalf of) policyholders, insurance acquisition cash flows and other costs that are incurred in fulfilling contracts. Insurance acquisition cash flows and other costs that are incurred in fulfilling contracts comprise both direct costs and an allocation of fixed and variable overheads. Cash flows are attributed to acquisition activities, other fulfilment activities and other activities at local entity level using activity- based costing techniques. Cash flows attributable to acquisition and other fulfilment activities are allocated to groups of contracts using methods that are systematic and rational and will be consistently applied to all costs that have similar characteristics. GEH Group derives the mortality and morbidity assumptions from its own historical experience where credible. Reference to industry tables, reinsurance rates, or pricing basis is made where historical experience is not credible. Mortality and morbidity rates are generally differentiated between policyholder groups, based on gender and smoker status.\n2.  Material Accounting Policy Information (continued) 2.20  Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements (continued) 2.20.3 Insurance Business (continued) Lapses and surrender are derived based on GEH Group’s own historical experience where credible. Where historical experience is not credible or not available, experience for similar product type is used as reference to derive the assumptions. Lapse and surrender assumptions generally vary by product type as well as policy years. Coverage Units In the determination of the coverage units (measured in dollar amounts), the type of service is identified based on the terms and features of the insurance contracts. Management judgement is then applied in determining the appropriate coverage unit against the type of service identified. The number of coverage units in a group is the quantity of coverage provided by the contracts in the group, determined by considering the quantity of the benefits provided by each contract in the group and its expected coverage duration. The coverage units are assessed at each reporting period-end prospectively by considering: a) the quantity of benefits provided by contracts in the group; b) the expected coverage period of contracts in the group; and c)  the likelihood of insured events occurring, only to the extent that they affect the expected coverage period of contracts in the group. GEH Group uses the amount that it expects the policyholder to be able to validly claim in each period if an insured event occurs as the basis for quantifying benefits with respect to insurance coverage. 2.20.4 Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Group performs an annual review of the carrying amount of its goodwill and other intangible assets, against the recoverable amounts of the CGU to which the goodwill and other intangible assets have been allocated. Recoverable amounts of banking CGUs are determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the respective CGUs’ continuing operations. The recoverable amount of insurance CGU is determined using the appraisal value method. Management exercises its judgement in estimating the future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates used in computing the recoverable amounts of the CGUs. In light of current macroeconomic conditions, management reassessed the assumptions applied in estimating the future cash flows, including growth rates and discount rates used in computing the recoverable amount, and determined that no impairment should be recognised during the year. 2.20.5 Income Taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in several jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the capital allowances and deductibility of certain expenses in estimating the income tax liabilities. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax balances in the period in which the determination is made. 2.21 Comparative Figures SFRS(I) 171)  GEH Group has applied the transitional provisions in SFRS(I) 17 and has not disclosed the impact of the adoption of SFRS(I) 17 on each financial statement line item. The effects of adopting SFRS(I) 17 at 1 January 2022 are presented in the statement of changes in equity. The effects from applying SFRS(I) 17 by GEH Group resulted in a reduction of the Group’s equity attributable to equity holders of $1,953 million, net of tax, as at 1 January 2022. 2)  The effects from applying SFRS(I) 17 by the Group’s associate resulted in the increase of the Group’s equity attributable to equity holders of $30 million as at 1 January 2022.\n2.

Income Tax Expense (continued) OECD Pillar Two Model Rules The Group is within the scope of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two model rules. Pillar Two legislation has not been enacted in Singapore, the Bank’s country of incorporation. Pillar Two legislation was enacted or substantively enacted in Japan, Luxembourg, Malaysia, South Korea, the United Kingdom and Vietnam, and will come into effect from 1 January 2024 for Luxembourg, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam, fiscal year beginning on or after 1 April 2024 for Japan and 1 January 2025 for Malaysia. Under the legislation, the Group is expected to be subject to top-up tax for the difference between their Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules effective tax rate per jurisdiction and the 15% minimum rate. As the Group is in the process of assessing its exposure to the Pillar Two legislation, the quantitative impact of the enacted or substantively enacted legislation is not yet reasonably estimable. The Group applies the exception to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes, as provided in the amendments to SFRS(I) 1-12 issued in May 2023. 12.

The issued ordinary shares have no par value and qualify as Common Equity Tier 1 capital for the Group.All issued shares were fully paid. Subsidiaries and associates of the Group did not hold shares in the capital of the Bank as at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022. 13.2 Share Option Scheme Executives of the Group ranked Manager and above and non-executive directors of the Group are eligible to participate in the OCBC Share Option Scheme 2001 (2001 Scheme). The Bank has ceased granting share options under the 2001 Scheme effective from financial year 2018 remuneration. Share options granted in prior years continue to be outstanding until the options lapse or are exercised by the recipients. Options granted to Group executives are exercisable for up to 10 years, while options granted to non-executive Directors are exercisable for up to five years. For the financial years ended 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, no options were granted under the 2001 Scheme.\n13.

The aggregate number of shares under outstanding options held by a director of the Bank was 43,512 (2022: 310,824). 13.3 Employee Share Purchase Plan The OCBC Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESP Plan) was implemented for all employees of the participating companies in the Group, including executive Directors. The ESP Plan is a saving-based share ownership plan to help employees own ordinary shares in the Bank through their monthly contributions via deductions from payroll and/or from Central Provident Fund. The employees have the option to convert the contributions to ordinary shares after one year or to withdraw the contributions at any time. As a further incentive to employees to enrol in the ESP Plan, the Bank pays interest on the amounts saved at a preferential interest rate. The duration of the offering period is 24 months. In July 2023, the Bank launched its eighteenth offering under the ESP Plan, which commenced on 1 September 2023 and will expire on 31 August 2025. Under the eighteenth offering, the Bank granted rights to acquire 8,899,030 (2022: 8,738,996) ordinary shares in the Bank. For the financial years ended 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, no rights were granted to directors of the Bank to acquire ordinary shares in the Bank. The fair value of rights, determined using the binomial valuation model, was $6.6 million (2022: $7.9 million).

At 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, no acquisition rights were held by directors of the Bank. 13.4 Deferred Share Plan The OCBC Deferred Share Plan (DSP) aims to increase the performance-orientation and retention factor in compensation packages of executives, and foster an ownership culture within the organisation. It also aligns the interests of executives with the sustained business performance of the Bank. Group executives holding the rank or equivalent rank of Assistant Manager and above, and any Group Executive Director selected by the Remuneration Committee, are eligible to participate in the DSP. Half (50%) of the share awards will vest after two years with the remaining 50% vesting at the end of three years in accordance with the guidelines established under the DSP. Prior to the vesting date, the executives will not be accorded voting rights for the shares. The Bank adopted the OCBC Deferred Share Plan 2021 (DSP 2021) on 29 April 2021 to replace the DSP, which was terminated on the same day. The termination of the DSP does not affect the awards which have been granted, whether such awards have been released (whether fully or partially) or not. By implementing the DSP 2021, which permits new ordinary shares to be issued, the Bank has greater flexibility in its methods for delivery of ordinary shares, as this can be effected through an issue of new ordinary shares, in addition to the transfer of existing ordinary shares (including treasury shares). During the year, 5,413,124 (2022: 9,734,401) deferred shares were released to employees under the DSP, of which 102,324 deferred shares were released to directors of the Bank who held office at 31 December 2023. Total awards of 6,785,111 (2022: 9,232,761) ordinary shares were granted and accepted by eligible executives under the DSP 2021 for the financial year ended 31 December 2023, of which 287,200 ordinary shares were granted to directors of the Bank who held office as at 31 December 2023. The fair value of the shares at grant date was $83.8 million (2022: $108.1 million). During the year, 3,787,000 (2022: nil) deferred shares were released to employees under the DSP 2021, of which 76,853 deferred shares were released to directors of the Bank who held office at 31 December 2023. The accounting treatment of share-based compensation plan is set out in Note 2.16.4.\n14.

They qualify as Additional Tier 1 capital of the Bank under the requirements of MAS. The 4.0% Capital Securities were fully redeemed by the Bank on 24 August 2023. (b)  The 3.0% Capital Securities issued by the Bank on 30 September 2020 are non-cumulative non-convertible perpetual capital securities. They qualify as Additional Tier 1 capital of the Bank under the requirements of MAS. The 3.0% Capital Securities may, subject to MAS approval, be redeemed at the option of the Bank on or after 30 September 2030 (First Reset Date), and each distribution payment date after the First Reset Date. The terms include a non-viability loss-absorbing feature. Under this feature, OCBC must write off the securities when: (1) the MAS notifies the Bank in writing that it is of the opinion that a write-off is necessary, without which the Bank would become non-viable; or (2) a decision by the MAS to make a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent support, without which the Bank would have become non-viable, as determined by the MAS. The Bank will, in consultation with or as directed by MAS, determine the amount to be written off in order for the non-viability event to cease to continue. In addition to the first call in 2030, the 3.0% Capital Securities may also be redeemed if a qualifying tax event or a change of qualification event occurs. The 3.0% Capital Securities bear a fixed distribution rate of 3.0% per annum from the issue date to the First Reset Date and will be reset every 10 years thereafter to a fixed rate equal to the then-prevailing 10-year SGD Swap Offer Rate plus 2.19%. With the cessation of the SGD Swap Offer Rate, and following the guidance released by the Steering Committee for SOR Transition to SORA for the transition of resettable fixed rate securities, the fixed distribution rate will be replaced with the sum of the SORA OIS of the same tenor and the 6-month MAS Recommended Rate Adjustment Spread of 0.3112% plus 2.19% if it is not redeemed at the First Reset Date. The non-cumulative distributions may only be paid out of distributable reserves semi-annually in March and September, unless cancelled by the Bank at its option. These constitute unsecured and subordinated obligations, ranking senior only to ordinary shares of the Bank.\n14.

The terms include a non-viability loss-absorbing feature. Under this feature, OCBC must write off the securities when: (1) the MAS notifies the Bank in writing that it is of the opinion that a write-off is necessary, without which the Bank would become non-viable; or (2) a decision by the MAS to make a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent support, without which the Bank would have become non-viable, as determined by the MAS. The Bank will, in consultation with or as directed by MAS, determine the amount to be written off in order for the non-viability event to cease to continue. In addition to the first call in 2027, the 3.9% Capital Securities may also be redeemed if a qualifying tax event or a change of qualification event occurs. The 3.9% Capital Securities bear a fixed distribution rate of 3.9% per annum from the issue date to the First Reset Date and will be reset every five years thereafter to a fixed rate equal to the then-prevailing five-year SORA-OIS rate plus 1.416%. The non-cumulative distributions may only be paid out of distributable reserves semi-annually in June and December, unless cancelled by the Bank at its option. These constitute unsecured and subordinated obligations, ranking senior only to ordinary shares of the Bank.

The existing structural value is the value of projected distributable profits from new businesses, which is calculated based on new businesses sold for the nine months ended up to 30 September and applying a new business multiplier to the value of future sales. A reasonably possible change in key assumptions will not cause the recoverable amount to decline materially below the carrying amount.\n37.

As at December 2023, the Group’s EVE had the maximum simulated reduction of $795 million under the supervisory prescribed Parallel Up (1) interest rate scenario. This was primarily driven by the impact from loans and bond holdings which would have a lower economic value under a rising interest rate environment, partially offset by the impact from deposits. For the Group’s NII, the scenario with the most adverse impact on net interest income was the Parallel Down (1) scenario, with a simulated decrease by $1,907 million. The lower NII was due to reduced interest income from loans under a downward interest rate shock scenario, partially offset by lower interest expense from deposits.

Unexpected demands for liquidity may be triggered by surrender of insurance policies due to negative publicity, deterioration of the economy, adverse news on other companies in the same or similar lines of business, unanticipated policy claims, or other unexpected cash demands from policyholders or derivative margin requirements. Expected liquidity demands are managed through a combination of treasury, investment and asset-liability management practices, which are monitored on an ongoing basis. Actual and projected cash inflows and outflows are regularly monitored, and a reasonable amount of liquid assets are maintained at all times. The projected cash flows from the in-force insurance policy contract liabilities consist of renewal premiums, commissions, claims, maturities and surrenders.

Measurement of ECL – Explanation of Inputs, Assumptions and Estimation Techniques The key inputs into the measurement of ECL are the following variables:• probability of default (PD); • loss given default (LGD); and • exposure at default (EAD). These parameters are derived from statistical models internally developed by GEH Group. PD represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on its financial obligation, either over the next 12 months (12M PD), or over the remaining lifetime (Lifetime PD) of the obligation. PD estimates are derived from PD models that incorporate both quantitative and qualitative inputs, which are in turn derived from internal and external compiled data. The model outputs are adjusted to reflect forward-looking information whenever appropriate. LGD is the magnitude of the likely loss incurred during a default. LGD is expressed as a percentage of loss per unit of exposure at the time of default and represents an estimate of the economic loss in the event of the default of the counterparty. Factors in determining LGDs include claim seniority, availability and quality of collateral, legal enforceability processes in the jurisdiction and industry of borrower and prevailing market conditions. They are estimates at a certain date and are derived using statistical models. These statistical models are developed using internally compiled data and incorporate both quantitative and qualitative factors. The model outputs are adjusted to reflect forward-looking information whenever appropriate. EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. GEH Group derives the EAD based on the current exposure to the counterparty and potential future exposure. The ECL is determined by the PD, LGD and EAD for each individual exposure. The ECLs are first determined by the product of these three components, which are then adjusted to take into account forward-looking information. The ECLs are finally discounted to the reporting date. The discount rate used in the ECL calculation is the original effective interest rate or an approximation thereof.

Definition of Default GEH Group considers a financial asset to be in default by assessing the following criteria: Quantitative Criteria For insurance receivables, the obligor is said to be in default if it fails to make contractual payments within 6 months after it falls due (i.e. after expiration of the maximum granted credit terms). For bonds and loans, the obligor is said to be in default if it fails to meet its contractual obligation and there are non-payments on another debt obligation of the same issuer to GEH Group. Qualitative Criteria The counterparty is in bankruptcy or has indications of potentially significant financial difficulty such as lawsuits or similar actions that threaten the financial viability of the counterparty; distressed exchange, merger or amalgamation without assumption or breach of material loan covenants not rectified within a given timeframe, restructuring with expected principal haircut or a breach in material loan covenant that is not rectified within given timeframe. The criteria above have been applied to all financial instruments held by GEH Group and are consistent with the definition of default used for credit", "bank": "OCBC", "year": "2023"}

All British pound, Euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen LIBORs, as well as the 1-week and 2-month US dollar LIBOR were discontinued on 31 December 2021. All remaining US dollar LIBORs were discontinued on 30 June 2023. The discontinuation of LIBOR had a direct impact on the viability of the Singapore Dollar Swap Offer Rate (SOR), which relied on US dollar LIBOR in its computation. Additionally, like LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR), a key benchmark widely used in retail loans, is subject to expert judgement due to a lack of underlying transactions. The Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA) was identified as the alternative benchmark to SOR and SIBOR. MAS established an industry-led Steering Committee for SOR & SIBOR Transition to SORA (SC-STS) to oversee the coordination and implementation of the transition efforts. To ensure a smooth transition from LIBOR to RFRs and SOR and SIBOR to SORA, the Group also established an internal Steering Committee to coordinate efforts across various business, control and support functions. The Group made the necessary system upgrades and modifications to ensure the readiness of our infrastructure and processes in a timely manner. We have also assessed the adequacy of provisions relating to the discontinuation of benchmarks in the Group’s documentation for loans, derivatives, debt instruments and other relevant transactions, and remediated the necessary documentation. With the cessation of USD LIBOR and SOR on 30 June 2023, all retail and corporate loans and derivatives referencing SOR have successfully transitioned to SORA, fixed rates or other industry standard replacement rates. Appropriate adjustments were made as recommended by the industry to reflect the differences between SOR and SORA. As of 31 December 2023, loans and derivatives referencing USD LIBOR have also successfully transitioned to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), fixed rates or other industry standard replacement rates as agreed between contracting parties. There was no significant impact from the cessation of USD LIBOR and SOR. For SIBOR, the transition will be completed in 2024 in line with the roadmap established by the industry. No significant impact is expected from the transition of SIBOR to SORA.\n41. Fair Values of Financial Instruments 41.1 Valuation", "bank": "OCBC", "year": "2023"}

Valuation adjustments are applied to account for input parameter uncertainties, known model deficiencies and other factors that may affect valuation. The main valuation adjustments are described below. Bid Offer Adjustments When the position is marked at mid-price, bid offer adjustment is applied to account for close out cost. Model Adjustments Model adjustments are applied when there are inherent limitations in the valuation models used by the Bank. Day 1 Profit or Loss Adjustments Day 1 profit or loss adjustments are applied when the valuation technique involves the use of significant inputs which are not readily observable. The difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price is deferred as an adjustment. The Day 1 profit or loss adjustments are released to the income statement when the significant inputs become observable, when the transaction is derecognised or amortised over the life of the transaction. Credit Valuation Adjustments Credit valuation adjustments are applied to account for the expected losses due to counterparty default on derivative positions. Collateral Valuation Adjustments Collateral valuation adjustments are applied when a derivative is denominated and discounted using a curve in the same currency but is collateralised in another currency. Parameter Uncertainty Adjustments These valuation adjustments mainly include adjustments for illiquid prices or internal methodologies used to derive model inputs. The Group’s internal audit provides independent assurance on the respective divisions’ compliance with the policy.\n41. Fair Values of Financial Instruments (continued) 41.2 Fair Values Financial instruments comprise financial assets, financial liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments. The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. For financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value on the financial statements, the Group has determined that their fair values were not materially different from the carrying amounts at the reporting date. The carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments of the Group are described below. Financial Assets Fair values of cash and balances with central banks, placements with banks, interest and other short term receivables are expected to approximate their carrying amounts due to their short tenor or frequent re-pricing. Securities held by the Group, comprising government securities and debt and equity securities are substantially carried at fair value on the balance sheet. Non-bank customer loans are mainly carried at amortised cost on the balance sheet, net of allowances for impaired and non-impaired loans. The Group deems that the carrying amounts of non-bank loans approximate their fair values as substantially all the loans are subject to frequent re-pricing. Financial Liabilities Fair value of certain financial liabilities, which include mainly customer deposits with no stated maturity, interbank borrowings and borrowings under repurchase agreements, are expected to approximate their carrying amounts due to their short tenor. For non-bank customer term deposits, contractual or derived cash flows are discounted at market rates as at reporting date to estimate the fair values, which approximate the carrying amounts. The fair values of the Group’s subordinated term notes and covered bonds are determined based on quoted market prices and independent broker offer prices. For other debts issued which are usually short term, the fair values approximate the carrying amounts. 41.3 Fair Value Hierarchy The Group determines the fair values of its financial assets and liabilities using various measurements. The different levels of fair value measurements are as follows:• Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; •  Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable market data either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from observable market data). The valuation techniques that use market parameters as inputs include, but are not limited to, yield curves, volatilities and foreign exchange rates; and • Level 3 – inputs for the valuation that are not based on observable market data.\n41.

Contingent Liabilities The Group conducts businesses involving acceptances, guarantees, documentary credits and other similar transactions. Acceptances are undertakings by the Group to pay on receipt of bills of exchange drawn. The Group issues guarantees on the performance of customers to third parties. Documentary credits commit the Group to make payments to third parties on presentation of stipulated documents. As the Group will only be required to meet these obligations in the event of customer’s default, the cash requirements of these instruments are expected to be considerably below their nominal contractual amounts.

This is lower than the amount of $4,325,913 paid for the financial year ended 31 December 2022 (FY 2022) mainly due to the smaller number of non-executive Directors in FY 2023 compared to FY 2022.

Details of the revised Directors’ fee structure and the breakdown of the Directors’ remuneration for FY 2023 can be found on pages 56 and 59 of the 2023 Annual Report. Ordinary Resolution 5(b) Resolution 5(b) is to authorise the Directors to issue ordinary shares of the Bank to the non-executive Directors as part of their remuneration for FY 2023. A non-executive Director of the Bank will be eligible for an award of ordinary shares if he/she has served in FY 2023, with the number of ordinary shares to be issued to a non-executive Director of the Bank who has served for less than the entire FY 2023 to be pro-rated accordingly, based on the length of his/her service during FY 2023. The non-executive Directors who are eligible for, and will receive, the award of ordinary shares as part of their remuneration for FY 2023 are Mr Andrew Lee Kok Keng, Mr Ooi Sang Kuang, Ms Chong Chuan Neo, Mr Chua Kim Chiu, Dr Andrew Khoo Cheng Hoe, Mr Koh Beng Seng, Dr Lee Tih Shih, Ms Christina Hon Kwee Fong (Christina Ong), Mr Seck Wai Kwong, Mr Pramukti Surjaudaja and Ms Tan Yen Yen. It is proposed that, for FY 2023, 6,000 ordinary shares be issued to each non-executive Director named above (FY 2022: 6,000 ordinary shares), save that 1,956 ordinary shares are proposed to be issued to Mr Seck Wai Kwong (who was appointed as a non-executive Director of the Bank on 4 September 2023) and 510 and 542 ordinary shares are proposed to be issued to Mr Ooi Sang Kuang and Mr Koh Beng Seng (who stepped down as non-executive Directors of the Bank on 31 January 2023 and 3 February 2023 respectively). The proposed award of ordinary shares is in addition to the Directors’ remuneration in cash to be proposed under Resolution 5(a).\nThe issue of ordinary shares under Resolution 5(b) will be made pursuant to Article 143 of the Constitution of the Bank by way of the issue of bonus shares for which no consideration is payable. Such ordinary shares will, upon issue, rank pari passu with the existing ordinary shares of the Bank. The SGX-ST has given in-principle approval for the listing and quotation of such new ordinary shares. Such approval is subject to (a) compliance with the SGX-ST’s listing requirements and guidelines, and (b) shareholders’ approval for the proposed allotment of such new ordinary shares in compliance with Listing Rule 804. The SGX-ST’s in-principle approval is not to be taken as an indication of the merits of such new ordinary shares, the Bank and/or its subsidiaries. The SGX-ST assumes no responsibility for the correctness of any of the statements or opinions made in this explanatory note to Resolution 5(b). The non-executive Directors who will each, subject to shareholders’ approval, be awarded ordinary shares as part of their remuneration for FY 2023, will abstain from voting in respect of, and will procure their associates to abstain from voting in respect of, Resolution 5(b). The Bank will disregard any votes cast by such persons in respect of their shareholdings on Resolution 5(b). Ordinary Resolution 7 Resolution 7 is to authorise the Directors from the date of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting until the next Annual General Meeting to issue ordinary shares of the Bank and/or to make or grant instruments (such as warrants or debentures) convertible into ordinary shares (Instruments), and to issue ordinary shares in pursuance of such Instruments, up to a number not exceeding 50 per cent. of the total number of issued ordinary shares of the Bank excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings, with a sub-limit of 10 per cent. for issues other than on a pro rata basis to shareholders of the Bank. For the purpose of determining the aggregate number of ordinary shares that may be issued, the total number of issued ordinary shares of the Bank excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings shall be based on the total number of issued ordinary shares of the Bank excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings at the time this Resolution is passed, after adjusting for (1) new ordinary shares arising from the conversion or exercise of any convertible securities or share options or vesting of share awards which were issued and are outstanding or subsisting at the time this Resolution is passed, and (2) any subsequent bonus issue, consolidation or subdivision of ordinary shares. For the avoidance of doubt, any consolidation or subdivision of ordinary shares of the Bank will require shareholders’ approval. As at 8 March 2024 (the Latest Practicable Date ), the Bank had 19,913,569 treasury shares and no subsidiary holdings. The Directors will only issue ordinary shares and/or Instruments under this Resolution if they consider it necessary and in the interests of the Bank. Ordinary Resolution 8 Resolution 8 is to authorise the Directors to (i) allot and issue ordinary shares in accordance with the provisions of the OCBC Share Option Scheme 2001 (the 2001 Scheme), (ii) grant rights to acquire, and allot and issue, ordinary shares in accordance with the provisions of the OCBC Employee Share Purchase Plan (the ESPP), and/or (iii) grant awards, and allot and issue ordinary shares, in accordance with the provisions of the OCBC Deferred Share Plan 2021 (the DSP 2021). The 2001 Scheme expired on 2 August 2021. No further options may be granted by the Bank under the 2001 Scheme following its expiry. However, the expiration of the 2001 Scheme does not affect the options which have been granted and accepted before the expiry of the 2001 Scheme, whether such options have been exercised (whether fully or partially) or not. The options which had previously been granted and accepted pursuant to the 2001 Scheme have fully vested. Although (i) the Rules of the 2001 Scheme provide that the aggregate number of new ordinary shares which may be issued pursuant to the 2001 Scheme shall not exceed 10 per cent. of the total number of issued ordinary shares of the Bank from time to time, (ii) the Rules of the ESPP provide that the aggregate number of new ordinary shares which may be issued pursuant to the ESPP, when aggregated with the aggregate number of new ordinary shares which may be issued pursuant to the 2001 Scheme and the DSP 2021, shall not exceed 10 per cent. of the total number of issued ordinary shares of the Bank excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings from time to time, and (iii) the Rules of the DSP 2021 provide that the aggregate number of new ordinary shares which may be issued pursuant to the DSP 2021, when aggregated with the aggregate number of new ordinary shares which may be issued pursuant to the 2001 Scheme and the ESPP, shall not exceed 10 per cent. of the total number of issued ordinary shares of the Bank excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings from time to time, Resolution 8 provides for a lower limit of 5 per cent. of the total number of issued ordinary shares of the Bank excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings from time to time, as the Bank does not anticipate that it will require a higher limit before the next Annual General Meeting.\nThe 2001 Scheme and the DSP 2021 are performance-based equity compensation/incentive plans (as opposed to the ESPP, which is a savings-based share ownership plan to help employees own ordinary shares in the Bank via deductions from payroll and/or (where applicable) Central Provident Fund (CPF) funds). Options and awards granted under these performance-based plans will lapse immediately upon termination of employment or appointment, except in certain events such as ill health, injury or disability, retirement at or after the applicable retirement age, redundancy or other events approved by the Remuneration Committee (the Committee ), in which case the Committee may allow all or any part of such options or awards to be preserved such that they can be exercisable or vest within the relevant exercise or vesting periods, or such periods as may be determined by the Committee. The 2001 Scheme and the DSP 2021 also contain provisions which allow for the cancellation and clawback of grants if it is determined, amongst other things, that they were made on the basis of materially inaccurate financial statements and/or that the grantee had engaged in conduct that resulted in financial loss, reputational harm, restatement of financial results or financial statements, adverse changes to the Bank’s and/or the Group’s", "bank": "OCBC", "year": "2023"}

Currently, share awards under the DSP 2021 are granted annually to eligible executives who are paid variable performance bonuses exceeding $100,000 for the previous year. The intention is that these share awards will form 20 to 40 per cent. of such eligible executives’ total variable performance bonus for the relevant year, with 50 per cent. vesting after two years and the remaining 50 per cent. vesting after three years, in accordance with the guidelines established under the DSP 2021. Given that the share awards are part of the variable performance bonuses already earned for the prior year (e.g., where the delivery of key performance indicator targets have already been completed), there are no further performance conditions imposed prior to the vesting of the share awards other than those described above and on pages 57 and 58 of the 2023 Annual Report relating to the conditions for cancellation and clawback of these share awards. Ordinary Resolution 9 Resolution 9 is to authorise the Directors to issue ordinary shares pursuant to the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited Scrip Dividend Scheme to members who, in respect of a qualifying dividend, have elected to receive scrip in lieu of the cash amount of that qualifying dividend. Ordinary Resolution 10 Resolution 10 is to renew the mandate to allow the Bank to purchase or otherwise acquire its issued ordinary shares, on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in this Resolution. The Bank intends to use its internal sources of funds to finance its purchase or acquisition of ordinary shares. The amount of financing required for the Bank to purchase or acquire its ordinary shares, and the impact on the Bank’s financial position, cannot be ascertained as at the date of this Notice as these will depend on whether the ordinary shares are purchased or acquired out of capital or profits of the Bank, the number of ordinary shares purchased or acquired, the price at which such ordinary shares were purchased or acquired and whether the ordinary shares purchased or acquired are held in treasury or cancelled. Based on the existing issued ordinary shares of the Bank as at the Latest Practicable Date, the purchase by the Bank of 5 per cent. of its issued ordinary shares (disregarding the ordinary shares held in treasury) will result in the purchase or acquisition of 224,748,862 ordinary shares. In the case of both market purchases and off-market purchases by the Bank and assuming that the Bank purchases or acquires the 224,748,862 ordinary shares at the Maximum Price of $13.70 for one ordinary share (being the price equivalent to 5 per cent. above the Average Closing Price of the ordinary shares traded on the SGX-ST for the five consecutive market days immediately preceding the Latest Practicable Date), the maximum amount of funds required for the purchase or acquisition of 224,748,862 ordinary shares is approximately $3,079.06 million. The financial effects of the purchase or acquisition of such ordinary shares by the Bank pursuant to the proposed Share Purchase Mandate on the audited financial statements of the Group and the Bank for FY 2023 based on these assumptions are set out in paragraph 2.7 of the Bank’s Letter to Shareholders dated 5 April 2024 (the Letter).
